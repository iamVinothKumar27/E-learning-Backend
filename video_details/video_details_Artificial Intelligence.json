        "transcript": "[Music] hello students in today's session we will learn about a chapter one introduction to AI in this chapter you will learn about understand what artificial intelligence AI is difference between human and machine intelligence AI applications in different areas branches advantages and disadvantages of AI so without any waiting let's explore this in interesting chapter and dive into a very adventurous World understanding artificial intelligence AI this is our first topic imagine if you had a robot friend who could play your favorite games with you help you finish your homework and even chat with you just like a real person this might sound like something out of a science fiction movie but thanks to something called artificial intelligence or AI it's actually possible artificial intelligence AI is a special kind of technology that allows machines like computers robots and even smartphones to think and learn in ways similar to humans just like how you learn new things every day whether it's solving a tricky math problem or learning how to ride a bicycle AI helps machines learn from their experiences this means that over time these machines can get better at tasks recognize patterns and even make decisions on their own now we will discuss that how artificial intelligence AI Works AI operates by learning from data large data sets teach machines how to make decisions or recognize patterns for instance AI might analyze thousands of pictures of cats to know what a cat looks like once it learns from the data it can identify a cat in a new picture let's discuss about key features of artificial intelligence AI learning AI systems can improve their performance over time through learning from data reasoning AI can make decisions based on available information similar to human reasoning problem solving AI can solve complex Problems by analyzing patterns and drawing conclusions perception AI systems can interpret and understand data from their surroundings like recognizing objects in an image or understanding speech for example have you ever asked your smartphone's Voice Assistant like Siri or Google Assistant to play your favorite song when you do that AI will work behind the scenes it helps The Voice Assistant understand your request and find the song you want to hear this is just one of the many ways AI makes our lives easier and more fun AI is becoming more more and more common in the world around us from the apps on your phone to the smart devices in your home AI is a big part of Modern Life helping to make things more convenient and enjoyable as you learn more about AI you'll discover how powerful and fascinating this technology is definition artificial intelligence AI is when computers or machines can think and learn like humans helping them perform tasks like recognizing images understanding language and making decisions need for artificial intelligence AI artificial intelligence is increasingly necessary because it can handle tasks that are difficult timec consuming or even impossible for humans to perform manually here are some critical reasons for the growing need for AI automation AI can automate repetitive tasks allowing humans to focus on more complex and creative work work for example factories use AI powered robots to assemble products reducing the need for manual labor handling Big Data AI can quickly process vast amounts of data this is particularly useful in fields like healthcare where AI can analyze medical records to detect patterns that might go unnoticed by human doctors improving decision making AI helps in making better decisions by analyzing data and predicting outcomes for example AI helps businesses decide what products to sell by analyzing customer preferences and market trends increased efficiency and speed AI can complete tasks more quickly and with fewer errors than humans for instance AI processes thousands of transactions per second in banking to detect fraudulent activity makes life easier AI makes everyday tasks more manageable by helping us find information quickly giving reminders or suggesting what we might like just like an intelligent assistant assists in difficult jobs AI can perform tasks that are too difficult or dangerous for humans like exploring deep oceans or outer space making it invaluable in Risky situations solves big problems AI helps solve complicated Problems by quickly analyzing large amounts of data which is especially useful in fields like health care for diagnosing diseases learns from experience AI improves by learning from its experiences much like how we improve at something with practice this ability to learn makes AI increasingly effective at what it does example imagine visiting a website and needing help finding something or tracking your order instead of waiting for a person to reply a friendly AI powered chat bot will help you instantly you can ask the chatbot any question like when will my package arrive and it will check the information and give you an answer right away it works 24/7 so the chatbot is always ready to help even if you ask at night amazingly this chat bot can talk to many people simultaneously answering questions for hundreds of users without getting tired it can also understand different languages so people from all over the world can get help quickly by taking care of simple tasks AI chat Bots allow human workers to focus on more complicated issues ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently human and machine intelligence human intelligence human intelligence is a natural ability to think learn and solve problems it helps us understand the world make decisions and act with others humans can also feel emotions be creative and generate new ideas for example you're using your intelligence to decide what to wear based on the weather you also use your intelligence to learn new things like how to ride a bike or solve a math problem machine Intelligence on the other hand machine intelligence is the ability of machines like computers and robots to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence however machines do this differently they don't have emotions or creativity like humans do instead they follow instructions given to them by humans these instructions are called algorithms which are like step-by-step guides machines use data to learn and get better at tasks over time but they do this by processing information quickly and following the rules set by their programming now we will learn about the difference between human and machine intelligence you can see the table [Music] here applications of artificial intelligence AI artificial intelligence AI is not just a concept it's something we use daily often without even realizing it here are some simple examples of how AI is used in the real world Healthcare AI helps doctors diagnose diseases by analyzing medical images predicting patient outcomes and suggesting treatment options AI can even assist in surgeries guiding surgeons with precise datadriven insights Etc education AI tools help teachers create personalized learning experiences for students AI powered platforms can track student progress and suggest lessons tailored to the students needs Transportation AI is used in self-driving cars to detect obstacles follow traffic rules and navigate roads AI also helps manage Traffic Systems in smart cities reducing congestion and improving Road Safety customer service AI powered chatbots provide real-time customer support on websites these chat Bots can answer common questions solve problems and help customers make purchases entertainment streaming platforms like Netflix and YouTube use AI algorithms to recommend content based on users viewing habits AI also creates music writes stories and and even paints fun fact AI helped create the famous portrait of edmon d bami a machine generated painting that sold for over $400,000 branches of artificial intelligence AI artificial intelligence is a vast field and it is divided into several branches each focusing on a different aspect of making machines more intelligent let's explore the main branches of AI machine learning ml machine learning is an AI that allows computers to learn from data and improve over time without being programmed for every specific task computers study data learn from it and make decisions based on it example if you use a streaming service like Netflix the app recommends movies or shows based on what you've watched previously this is machine learning in action natural language processing NLP n LP helps machines understand and communicate in human language this allows computers to read listen and even respond to our speech or text allowing us to talk to machines like others example when you ask Alexa or Google Assistant to play your favorite song they understand your request through NLP and respond accordingly robotics AI is used in robots to help them perform physical tasks robots can be programed to assemble products explore dangerous areas or even assist in surgeries example robots are used in factories to assemble cars or Electronics doing tasks that are too repetitive or risky for humans computer vision computer vision allows AI to see by interpreting and understanding images or videos AI recognizes objects faces or even handwritten text using this branch examp example face recognition in smartphones uses computer vision to unlock the phone by recognizing the user's face deep learning deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks designed to mimic the human brain it helps AI understand complex data and perform speech and image recognition tasks example AI that can identify pictures of animals or even diagnose diseases from x-rays uses deep learning to learn from thousand of examples advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence AI advantages of artificial intelligence ai ai brings many benefits to our world here are some of the key advantages efficiency and speed AI can process large amounts of data much faster than humans it can handle repetitive tasks quickly and without getting tired which increases productivity and reduces errors example AI systems and Banks can process thousands of transactions per second checking for fraud and managing accounts faster than a human could 24/7 availability unlike humans AI systems don't need to sleep or take breaks this means AI can work around the clock offering Services anytime people need them example customer service chat Bots provide help at any hour of the day ensuring customers always get the support they need even late at night accuracy and precision AI reduces the chance of human errors in tasks it can perform calculations and analyze data more accurately than humans especially with large data sets example AI can assist doctors in healthare by analyzing medical images and detecting diseases with high accuracy sometimes better than the human eye learning and Improvement through machine learning AI systems improve over time as they learn from new data making them more useful the longer they are used example Voice Assistant like Siri or Alexa improve as they learn how you speak and your preferences making their responses more personalized handling complex tasks AI can analyze and solve complex Problems by processing vast amounts of data this is useful in areas like scientific research where AI helps solve challenging problems humans alone can't handle example AI is used in climate science to analyze weather patterns and predict future climate changes disadvantages of AI while AI offers many advantages there are also some drawbacks to using it here are some key disadvantages lack of emotions AI cannot feel emotions or understand human feelings this limits use in areas where empathy or emotional understanding is needed such as counseling or teaching example a robot or AI system can't comfort someone feeling sad like a human could high cost creating and maintaining AI systems can be expensive it requires a lot of resources to develop AI software collect and manage data and ensure that the systems are working correctly example building a self-driving car requires advanced technology sensors and robust AI software making it costly dependence on data AI relies heavily on data the AI system can make wrong decisions if the data used to train the AI is biased incomplete or inaccurate AI needs high quality data to perform well example if an AI system is trained on bass data it might make unfair decisions like like favoring one group of people in the hiring process job displacement as AI systems take over specific tasks there is a concern that they could replace human jobs especially in manufacturing customer service and data processing example AI powered robots and factories might replace workers who use to assemble products manually ethical and privacy concerns AI systems often require large amounts of data including personal information this raises privacy concerns about how that data is collected and used there are also ethical concerns about AI decision- making in law enforcement or medicine example facial recognition systems used in public places can raise privacy issues if people are being watched without consent [Music]"

        "transcript": "On the internet, the algorithms are all around you. You are watching this video because an algorithm brought it to you (among others) to click, which you did, and the algorithm took note. When you open the TweetBook, A the algorithm decides what you see. When you search through your photos, A the algorithm does the finding. Maybe even makes a little movie for you. When you buy something, A the algorithm sets the price and A the algorithm is at your bank watching transactions for fraud. The stock market is full of algorithms trading with algorithms. Given this, you might want to know how these little algorithmic bots shaping your world work, especially when they don't. In Ye Olden Days, humans built algorithmic bots by giving them instructions the humans could explain. \"If this, then that.\" But many problems are just too big and hard for a human to write simple instructions for. There's a gazillion financial transactions a second, which ones are fraudulent? There's octillion videos on NetMeTube. Which eight should the user see as recommendations? Which shouldn't be allowed on the site at all? For this airline seat, what is the maximum price this user will pay right now? Algorithmic bots give answers to these questions. Not perfect answers,\nbut much better than a human could do. But how these bots work exactly,\nmore and more, no one knows. Not even the humans who built them, or \"built them\", as we will see... Now companies that use these bots\ndon't want to talk about how they work because the bots are valuable employees. Very, VERY valuable. And how their brains are built is a fiercely guarded trade secret. Right now the cutting edge is most likely very 'I hope you like linear algebra', but what the current hotness is on any particular site and how the bots work, \nis a bit \"I dunno\", and always will be. So let's talk about one of the more quaint but understandable ways bots CAN be \"built\" without understanding how their brains work. Say you want a bot that can recognize\nwhat is in a picture. Is it a bee, or is it a three? It's easy for humans (even little humans), but it's impossible to just tell a bot \nin bot language how to do it, because really we just know \nthat's a bee and that's a three. We can say in words what makes them different, \nbut bots don't understand words. And it's the wiring in our brains \nthat makes it happen anyway. While an individual neuron may be understood, and clusters of neurons' general purpose vaguely grasped, the whole is beyond. Nonetheless, it works. So to get a bot that can do this sorting, you don't build it yourself. You build a bot that builds bots,\nand a bot that teaches bots. These bots' brains are simpler,\nsomething a smart human programmer can make. The builder bot builds bots, \nthough it's not very good at it. At first it connects the wires and modules in the bot brains almost at random. This leads to some very... \"special\" student bots sent to teacher bot to teach. Of course, teacher bot can't\ntell a bee from a three either; if the human could build teacher bot to do that, \nwell, then, problem solved. Instead the human gives teacher bot a bunch of \"bee\" photos, and \"three\" photos, and an answer key to which is what. Teacher bot can't teach, but teacher bot can TEST. The adorkable student bots stick out their tongues, try very hard, but they are bad at what they do. Very, VERY, bad. And it's not their fault, really, \nthey were built that way. Grades in hand, the student bots take a march of shame back to builder bot. those that did best are put to one side, the others recycled. Builder bot still isn't good at building bots, but now it takes those left\nand makes copies with changes in new combinations. Back to school they go. Teacher bot teaches - er, tests again, and builder bot builds again. And again, and again. Now a builder that builds at random, \nand a teacher that doesn't teach, just tests, and students who can't learn, they just are what they are, in theory shouldn't work, but in practice, it does. Partly because in every iteration, builder bot's slaughterhouse keeps the best and discards the rest, and partly because teacher bot isn't overseeing an old-timey, one-room schoolhouse with a dozen students, but an infinite warehouse with thousands of students. The test isn't ten questions, but a million questions. And how many times does the test, build, test loop repeat? As many as necessary. At first students that survive are just lucky, but by combining enough lucky bots, and keeping only what works, and randomly messing around with new copies of that eventually a student bot emerges that isn't lucky, that can perhaps barely tell bees from threes. As this bot is copied and changed,\nslowly the average test score rises, and thus the grade needed to survive the next round gets higher and higher. Keep this up and eventually from the infinite warehouse (slaughterhouse) a student bot will emerge, who can tell a bee from a three in a photo it's never seen before pretty well. But how the student bot does this, neither the teacher bot nor the builder bot, nor the human overseer, can understand. Nor the student bot itself. After keeping so many useful random changes,\nthe wiring in its head is incredibly complicated, and while an individual line of code may be understood, and clusters of code's general purpose vaguely grasped, the whole is beyond, nonetheless, it works. But this is frustrating, especially as the student bot is very good at exactly only the kinds of questions it's been taught to. It's great with photos, but useless with videos or baffled if the photos are upside down, or things that are obviously not bees, it's confident are. Since teacher bot can't teach, all the human overseer can do is give it more questions, to make the test even longer, to include the kinds of questions the best bots get wrong. This is important to understand. It's a reason why companies are \nobsessed with collecting data. More data equals longer tests equals better bots. So when you get the \"Are you human?\" test on a website, you are not only proving that you are human, \n(hopefully), but you are also helping to build the test to make bots that can read, or count, or tell lakes from mountains, or horses from humans. Seeing lots of questions about driving lately? Hmm...! What could that be building a test for? Now figuring out what's in a photo, or on a sign, or filtering videos, requires humans to make correct enough tests. But there is another kind of test that makes itself. Tests ON the humans. For example, say entirely hypothetical NetMeTube wanted users to keep watching as long as possible? Well, how long a user stays on the site is easy to measure. So, teacher bot gives each student bot a bunch of NetMeTube users to oversee, the student bots watch what their user watches, looks at their files, and do their best to pick the videos\nthat keep the user on the site. The longer the average, the higher their test score. Build, test, repeat. A million cycles later, there's a student bot who's pretty good at keeping the users watching, at least compared to what a human could build. But when people ask:\n\"How does the NetMeTube algorithm select videos?\" Once again, there isn't a great answer other than pointing to the bot, and the user data it had access to, and most vitally, how the human overseers \ndirect teacher bot to score the test. That's what the bot is trying to be good at to survive. But what the bot is thinking, or how it thinks it,\nis not really knowable. All that's knowable is this student bot\ngets to be the algorithm, because it's point one percent better than the previous bot at the test the humans designed. So everywhere on the internet, behind the scenes,\nthere are tests to increase user interaction, or set prices just right to maximize revenue, or pick the posts from all your friends you'll like the most, or articles people will share the most, or whatever. If it's testable, it's teachable. Well, \"teachable\", and a student bot will graduate from the warehouse \nto be the algorithm of its domain. At least, for a little while. We're used to the idea that the tools we use, even if we don't understand them, someone does, but with our machines that learn we are increasingly in a position where we use tools, or are used by tools, that no one, not even their creators, understand. We can only hope to guide them with the tests we make, and we need to get comfortable with that, as our algorithmic bot buddies are all around, \nand not going anywhere. OK. The bots are watching. You know what's coming. This is where I need to ask you... To like... comment... ...and subscribe. And bell me. And share on the TweetBook. The algorithm is watching. It won't show people the video... unless you do this. Look what you've reduced me to, bots. What do you want? Do you want watch time? Is that what you want? Fine. (sigh...) Hey guys, did you know I also have podcasts you can listen to? Maybe even just in the background while you're tidying up your all room for hours? Or whatever? There's hours of audio entertainment for you, \nand watch time for the bots overseeing your actions. Go ahead and - and take a click.\nEntertain yourself. Help me. Help the bots."

        "transcript": "we know humans learn from their past experiences and machines follow instructions given by humans but what if humans can train the machines to learn from the past data and do what humans can do and much faster well that's called machine learning but it's a lot more than just learning it's also about understanding and reasoning so today we will learn about the basics of machine learning so that's paul he loves listening to new songs he either likes them or dislikes them paul decides this on the basis of the song's tempo genre intensity and the gender of voice for simplicity let's just use tempo and intensity for now so here tempo is on the x axis ranging from relaxed to fast whereas intensity is on the y axis ranging from light to soaring we see that paul likes the song with fast tempo and soaring intensity while he dislikes the song with relaxed tempo and light intensity so now we know paul's choices let's say paul listens to a new song let's name it as song a song a has fast tempo and a soaring intensity so it lies somewhere here looking at the data can you guess whether paul will like the song or not correct so paul likes this song by looking at paul's past choices we were able to classify the unknown song very easily right let's say now paul listens to a new song let's label it as song b so song b lies somewhere here with medium tempo and medium intensity neither relaxed nor fast neither light nor soaring now can you guess whether paul likes it or not not able to guess whether paul will like it or dislike it are the choices unclear correct we could easily classify song a but when the choice became complicated as in the case of song b yes and that's where machine learning comes in let's see how in the same example for song b if we draw a circle around the song b we see that there are four votes for like whereas one would for dislike if we go for the majority votes we can say that paul will definitely like the song that's all this was a basic machine learning algorithm also it's called k nearest neighbors so this is just a small example in one of the many machine learning algorithms quite easy right believe me it is but what happens when the choices become complicated as in the case of song b that's when machine learning comes in it learns the data builds the prediction model and when the new data point comes in it can easily predict for it more the data better the model higher will be the accuracy there are many ways in which the machine learns it could be either supervised learning unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning let's first quickly understand supervised learning suppose your friend gives you one million coins of three different currencies say one rupee one euro and one dirham each coin has different weights for example a coin of one rupee weighs three grams one euro weighs seven grams and one dirham weighs four grams your model will predict the currency of the coin here your weight becomes the feature of coins while currency becomes the label when you feed this data to the machine learning model it learns which feature is associated with which label for example it will learn that if a coin is of 3 grams it will be a 1 rupee coin let's give a new coin to the machine on the basis of the weight of the new coin your model will predict the currency hence supervised learning uses labeled data to train the model here the machine knew the features of the object and also the labels associated with those features on this note let's move to unsupervised learning and see the difference suppose you have cricket data set of various players with their respective scores and wickets taken when you feed this data set to the machine the machine identifies the pattern of player performance so it plots this data with the respective wickets on the x-axis while runs on the y-axis while looking at the data you'll clearly see that there are two clusters the one cluster are the players who scored higher runs and took less wickets while the other cluster is of the players who scored less runs but took many wickets so here we interpret these two clusters as batsmen and bowlers the important point to note here is that there were no labels of batsmen and bowlers hence the learning with unlabeled data is unsupervised learning so we saw supervised learning where the data was labeled and the unsupervised learning where the data was unlabeled and then there is reinforcement learning which is a reward based learning or we can say that it works on the principle of feedback here let's say you provide the system with an image of a dog and ask it to identify it the system identifies it as a cat so you give a negative feedback to the machine saying that it's a dog's image the machine will learn from the feedback and finally if it comes across any other image of a dog it will be able to classify it correctly that is reinforcement learning to generalize machine learning model let's see a flowchart input is given to a machine learning model which then gives the output according to the algorithm applied if it's right we take the output as a final result else we provide feedback to the training model and ask it to predict until it learns i hope you've understood supervised and unsupervised learning so let's have a quick quiz you have to determine whether the given scenarios uses supervised or unsupervised learning simple right scenario one facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs scenario 2 netflix recommends new movies based on someone's past movie choices scenario 3 analyzing bank data for suspicious transactions and flagging the fraud transactions think wisely and comment below your answers moving on don't you sometimes wonder how is machine learning possible in today's era well that's because today we have humongous data available everybody is online either making a transaction or just surfing the internet and that's generating a huge amount of data every minute and that data my friend is the key to analysis also the memory handling capabilities of computers have largely increased which helps them to process such huge amount of data at hand without any delay and yes computers now have great computational powers so there are a lot of applications of machine learning out there to name a few machine learning is used in healthcare where diagnostics are predicted for doctor's review the sentiment analysis that the tech giants are doing on social media is another interesting application of machine learning fraud detection in the finance sector and also to predict customer churn in the e-commerce sector while booking a gap you must have encountered surge pricing often where it says the fair of your trip has been updated continue booking yes please i'm getting late for office well that's an interesting machine learning model which is used by global taxi giant uber and others where they have differential pricing in real time based on demand the number of cars available bad weather rush r etc so they use the surge pricing model to ensure that those who need a cab can get one also it uses predictive modeling to predict where the demand will be high with the goal that drivers can take care of the demand and search pricing can be minimized great hey siri can you remind me to book a cab at 6 pm today ok i'll remind you thanks no problem comment below some interesting everyday examples around you where machines are learning and doing amazing jobs so that's all for machine learning basics today from my site keep watching this space for more interesting videos until then happy learning"

        "transcript": "[Music] so broadly let us now try to understand what are the different types of techniques in a machine learning machine learning techniques can be categorized under two main heads one is called supervised learning and second is called unsupervised learning supona supervised learning is a machine learning task of finding a function from a labeled data what is a label data I have got a data set which has got many active use many variables for example I have got data of my customers customer ID age gender occupation their transaction behavior attributes and I have one more additional information saying whether the customer is has churned or not children this column which says which customer has churned and which customer has not churned is called the labeled data this kind of data when I analyze to understand the profile of customers who have churned we have enough profile of customers who haven't not churned I use a technique which will fall under the head supervised learning the labeled class column can also be called as your dependent variable and this class when I analyze with respect to variables like age gender occupation and they passed a buying behavior those variables are called independent variables let's now see what is unsupervised learning unsupervised learning is a machine learning task of exploring the data to derive some inferences or insight from a data the same data which we talked about where I had data of my customers age gender occupation and a class which is whether the customer has churned or not churn if I remove this column I assume that this column whether the customer has churned or not journal if that column is not present in my data set and if I analyze the data in that case this analysis will fall under the head unsupervised learning so in unsupervised learning I will be doing analysis to find out what are the different types of customer segments that I have or what are the types of attributes which are similar between various customers all those things would go under the head of unsupervised learning so broadly speaking if you have a target variable or a labeled class column and then you are doing an analysis in that case it will be a supervised learning if you do not have a labeled class column and you are doing analysis it will go under the head unsupervised learning let us now try to understand supervised learning at in slightly greater length in the supervised learning when you have a data set there will be input attributes called independent variables and there will be a labeled class column which is your target variable or the desired output now you are trying analyze the data wherein you are trying to establish a relationship between your labeled class and the independent input variables feature variables so to analyze this you pass this dataset through a learning algorithm which will be a supervised learning algorithm the supervised learning algorithm will try to find patterns and relationship between the input attributes independent variables and the dependent labelled class based upon the relationships it identifies it is going to give you a model and that model we call a predictive model I am based on the predictive model it is also going to predict the output of those set of records and this is called a supervised learning process to check the model performance what we can do is we can compare the output which is predicted with respect to our desired output and based upon how accurate we make prediction we can have various model performance measures this is what a supervised learning algorithm is all about two main classifications of supervised learning techniques one is a classification and second is regression classification comes when when we are trying to predict the output which is say Class A versus Class me when the output prediction is about a class which record will fall under which head for example credit-card transactions I want to predict whether a credit-card transaction is a for you length transaction or are not fraudulent connection in that case it comes a classification problem regression when my target variable is a continuous variable for example I want to predict the amount a customer is going to spend on a credit card based upon his past purchase patterns and if I'm trying to make a prediction about the Spence the customer is going to make in the next month it will be a continuous target variable in that case we'll call it as a regression process so supervised learning techniques two main broad classifications two broad classic categorization supervised learning techniques are classification or a regression technique now let us come to unsupervised learning technique in unsupervised learning technique as I already mentioned we do not have a labeled class we have a input data and we are trying to analyze things with respect to the given set of input data and this set of data when we analyze using some unsupervised learning technique there are three main classifications one is called a dimension reduction technique for example when I have got data and I am trying to reduce the number of variables in data in that case I call it as a dimension reduction technique some of the dimension reduction techniques most used are principal component analysis factor analysis now when the same data when I am trying to reduce the number of records number of cases that supervised learning technique unsupervised learning technique we call clustering and there is a third type of unsupervised learning technique which is called Association analysis Association analysis example market basket analysis in a market basket analysis what we try to see what are the different products what are the different items the customer buys together this kind of Association analysis is very commonly used by ecommerce for recommendation engine you buy up certain product on an e-commerce portal and the website automatically suggests you what is the Associated product that many other consumers have purchased along with it that is called Association analysis in unsupervised learning technique we directly get a output if you compare a supervised learning versus unsupervised learning let's go back to a supervised learning slate in an unsupervised learning you see we had an input attribute and we had desired label class the algorithm tries to find a relationship between the target variable and independent variables and based upon that it builds a model which is a predictive model and you get a predicted output I can save this predictive model and I can use this predictive model for future prediction about new set of Records that I get for these new set of records my customers I can apply the predictive model and predict their lightly future behavior whereas in an unsupervised learning I have an input data I pass it through unsupervised learning I get a compute that output I can directly use for my own understanding of of some other technique which is likely to follow consequently but there is no model of model in this case I cannot use I do not get a model which can can apply on future records that I am going to get so that is the main difference one of the differences between supervised learning and unsupervised [Music]"

        "transcript": "hello everybody and welcome back so in this video what I'm gonna be doing is sharing with you my top four machine learning techniques that you need to know now there's so many different ways of doing machine learning and artificial intelligence but these are kind of the four main methods and you need to understand what these methods are so you can appropriately pick the right one for whatever project you're working on it's one thing to go through tutorials and to watch other people apply specific algorithms to specific projects but to actually be able to pick which algorithm that you're gonna use for your own project is its own skill and hopefully this video will help you do that so without further ado we're gonna have a quick word from our sponsor and then we'll get right into it before we get started I would like to thank simply learn for sponsoring this video and giving you all 10% off their data science master's course by enrolling with the code data with Tim this course will give you hands-on exposure to key technologies including our Python tableau Hadoop and spark and you'll receive world-class training by an industry leader on the most in-demand data science and machine learning skills since this course is co-developed with IBM you'll receive perks such as twelve hundred US dollars worth of IBM cloud credits access to IBM cloud platforms such as IBM Watson and digital badges from IBM you can check it out at the link in the description so I want to make it clear distinction just to start the video here on what I mean by machine learning a lot of people confuse artificial intelligence and machine learning and to be honest with you the internet does not make this easy to kind of distinguish between a lot of people will label their stuff as machine learning when really you know it's a different artificial intelligence strain or they'll say AI and it's not Mitch if people get really confused so let's clear it up right now machine learning is a strain of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is kind of the top tier and everything kind of trickles down from there where machine learning is its own kind of topic within artificial intelligence you can have other things like evolutionary algorithms or you could have different kind of AI algorithms that do specific things that are in their own little bubble machine learning is one of its own bubbles that strains from artificial intelligence now the topics I'm gonna be talking about here in the methods are kind of strains off of machine learning so the different types of machine learning they're not necessarily algorithms there's algorithms that are involved with these methods but they're kind of their own strain and different algorithms will fit into that so with that being said let's talk about the first algorithm which is reinforcement learning now reinforcement learning is a very popular method for training AIS to play video games and that's kind of the example I'm gonna use to explain how this works now reinforcement learning is learning by trial and error and essentially what that means is our AI starts off being extremely stupid having no idea what to do it's seen no prior data before and doesn't know what the level looks like it doesn't know anything and it starts taking random actions so this is where I'm gonna introduce to us three concepts an agent and environment and a reward now our agent is gonna be our artificial intelligence and in this case when we're talking about a game it would be the player of the game or whatever AI you're trying to train our environment is gonna be if we're talking about a game maybe the level in which this agent is playing but in other situations your environment is kind of what you're exploring and what you're trying to optimize or do the best in and then we have a reward and the reward is what our agent is trying to maximize the agent is going to be navigating the environment and based on the actions it takes it's going to be given a reward that reward will come you know from the programmer they will determine what reward the agent gets at what specific scenario for doing what specific action and essentially the goal of the agent is maximize this roar so it starts navigating the level kind of figuring out what it needs to do in navigating the environment and as it does this it starts to realize based on the actions it takes which actions maximize the reward so if we're talking about maybe a Mario game for example Mario will start off maybe running left so going out of the level and it will be given a negative reward and told don't do that stop doing that so the next time this happens it's gonna go the other direction because it says well I know left is bad that minimizes my reward so where can I go to maximize it so don't start going right and then maybe it hits an obstacle it's gonna back okay so when I get to that point rather than hitting the obstacle which gives me a negative reward let's go around the obstacle let's do something that gives me a positive reward and this is the basic premise of reinforcement learning and now on to our next topic which is supervised machine learning now a lot of people to classify this as kind of the most basic and most boring form of machine learning and I would agree but that also makes it one of the most useful now a lot of people that get into machine learning think that you need to use very advanced MA to use neural networks and crazy evolutionary things to solve problems when in reality a lot of the problems that you have can actually be solved with supervised machine learning models now what is supervised machine learning well you start in supervised machine learning with some previous knowledge or some previous data that is step one you're not going to be doing supervised machine learning unless you have some data to work with and what you're going to be doing is essentially trying to come up with some function that can map the input of your data to the output of your data the reason you want to do this is because you have all this previous data and you want to come up with some kind of correlations between them so you want to say hey maybe if a student has high grades that would relate with them studying for a long amount of hours so what you're gonna do is say okay we handled this previous data we're gonna feed it into this machine learning algorithm and it's gonna come up with this function and your goal is with this function that when you pass it some input data that it's never seen before so some data that you're trying to make a prediction for it can give you an accurate prediction for that specific value so that's why you need a lot of data usually to make this work well so what you're gonna do is feed you know the input of this data into the model it's gonna look at it it's gonna spit out some output it's gonna compare that output to what the output should be and then say okay I need to make a tweak here or tune here to make this function a little bit better and this is why it's called a supervised machine learning algorithm because you can almost think of it as like a teacher teaching the model what to do and how to get better where it starts not being very good but as it sees more and more data the teachers like know do that do that you need to fix that tweak that it gets better better better better until you reach a point where you're satisfied with the accuracy of your model and that is supervised machine learning and the next topic to talk about is unsupervised machine learning so in supervised machine learning what we had was some input data and he actually had the answer to that input Deb so we had for example all this information about a student and maybe we're trying to predict their final grade we actually had a bunch of previous students final grades so when we ran through the model we could tell the model when it got something wrong hey you were you know one grade point off from what this grade actually should be based on your current state so let's tune you a bit let's fix you a bit and let's get better unsupervised machine learning we don't actually have the answers to our data we have a ton of different data and we actually don't know what kind of the answer is for what we're looking for the problem itself is slightly undefined and what we're trying to actually do with unsupervised machine learning is have the computer or the algorithm come up with some correlations between our data that we can't see ourselves so maybe we're trying to predict you know something with supervised machine learning we want to figure out what a grades gonna be we want to cluster this information together we want to classify something and we actually know the correct answer whereas here we want to come up with things about our data that we don't know so this is where we talk about something called clustering now I think I made a mistake and I mentioned clustering with supervised machine learning that is not correct clustering typically is gonna be an unsupervised machine learning in a common algorithm in unsupervised machine learning is k-means clustering where maybe we feed a bunch of data points so we only have input data we feed a ton of data points to our model or algorithm and what it does is actually clusters and figures out which data points are related together so maybe we're trying to figure out what you know information will relate someone to be a part of a specific ethnic group or something like that we're looking at some big data well we don't know how many groups we might have in our data how they might be we don't want to specify those so we just pass this information into the computer it does some of this magic stuff with the unsupervised machine learning algorithm and spits back to us a bunch of different clusters of this group and when we pass in a new data point that we haven't seen before well what it does is say okay you are a part of this cluster or you are a part of this group so unsupervised machine learning algorithms are typically used to try to figure out stuff about the data we're trying to determine different groups or different kind of pieces of information and some abstract correlations that we maybe can't see ourself as a programmer or as someone that's analyzing the information a final reminder that if you're interested in becoming an expert in data science to consider the simply learned data science masters course it's comprised of six full courses including our programming data science with Python machine learning tableau desktop qualified associate training Big Data Hadoop spark developer and data science capstone and has three electives such as IBM Watson for chatbots machine learning with our data science with sass now during this course should work on 15 plus real-life projects and learned 30 plus in-demand skills with lifetime access to all of the course content this course is listed at $1,300 which is as low as 115 dollars a month and you can use the discount code data with Tim for a limited time at 10% discount I would personally recommend this course and encourage you guys to take advantage of this offer and now to talk about deep learning now deep learning is by far one of the most kind of looked up to and just like advanced parts of machine learning now a lot of people that get into machine learning just immediately jump into deep learning they see all these neural network things on YouTube they see neural network neural network neural network and they start just learning it and doing it and this was great and you can do this but deep learning is really not applicable to a lot of different tasks or maybe it is but it's way overkill and you could solve a lot of the same tasks that people are doing with deep learning and neural networks which is basic supervised machine learning algorithms or reinforcement learning are simple you know very basic things to setup and to work with so what is deep learning well I've kind of said it already but it's pretty much just working within their own networks now the reason we call this deep is because a neural network has more than one layer so whereas in our other algorithms we kind of just had an input and an output and we had a function that kind of classified or did something with that with a neural network we have layers so we have an input layer we have some hidden layers in the middle we have an output layer and our data actually gets passed through all of these different layers to pick out specific high-level features of it now this is why neural networks are used a lot for classification tasks related to things that have patterns in them so for example doing object detection or image recognition a classic example is going to be with the amnestied data set what essentially you're hoping a neural network is gonna do when you train it on a data set like an amnesty data set which essentially is a bunch of handwritten digits and you want to figure out if there's zeros or if they're ones 2 through 9 is you're gonna pass all the pixels of this image in and then the network's actually gonna look at these pixels try to pick out like lines and features and curves and edges of it and and what the number is based on seeing all those different features that it's kind of created and and figured out so neural networks are really good at looking at higher dimensional features that you can't specifically see in the data set or that actually don't exist it will create those features for you based on the input that you're giving it but this means that it's very complicated it's very complex you don't usually understand how you're actually solving the problem when you're using a neural network because you kind of just give some input you get an output and you don't have any idea what happens in between and that's the dangerous thing when you run into an issue where your neural networks not performing correctly it's very difficult to tweak it and modify it and a lot of the times there's not much you can do because you really just don't understand what's happening in the middle so this has been kind of the four main topics in machine learning now I always like to say that I am no expert there's a lot that I still need to learn I'm a student myself and this stuff is really interesting to me and that's why I go out of my way to make videos like this and to teach other people because I want them to be able to learn the same things that I've done I find a lot of people on the internet what they do is explain things super complicated and just try to make it seem like they're very smart that's really not how I want to come off I want to explain this to you guys as simply as possible so that you can you know go out there and learn it yourself a lot of this stuff is really not that hard it's just you have to have a little bit of knowledge and know where to look to find the information so with that being said that has been the video if you guys learn something you'd like this and you want more content like this please leave a like on the video leave a comment down below and subscribe to the channel and with that being said I will see you guys"

        "transcript": "[Music] robots have jumped from the screen and science fiction pages into our reality disrupting almost every modern industry agriculture space travel medicine and manufacturing are just a couple of places robots have begun to appear you could argue that they have already started to take over our world just in the past few decades robots have reached new heights the continual and rapid progress of artificial intelligence paired with readily available large data sets lower prices for sensors and electronics and a steady demand for efficiency has created the perfect storm for engineered innovation yet you should not be intimidated by robots though robots are certainly complicated pieces of machinery they are also delightfully simple to understand in a lot of cases robots are based on us humans you can even build your own simple robot at home but before you can go off and make your own you should understand a robot's workings first defining a robot can be tricky as it tends to be used as a blanket term to describe any machine that can perform work or other actions normally performed by humans either automatically or by remote control on the most basic level there are five major human organ systems that have a corollary in robotics a skeletal structure a muscle system to move the skeleton a sensory system that receives information about the body and the surrounding environment a power source to activate the muscles and sensors and finally a brain that processes sensory information and tells the muscles what to do many types of robots also include these systems first you have the controller of the robot which could also be called the brain of the robot a computer program usually runs this and it gives the robot detailed commands to follow secondly you have mechanical parts these can include the motors pistons grippers wheels and gears and help the robot move grab turn and lift they are usually powered by air water or electricity robots also have sensors that help them determine sizes shapes space between objects and direction and finally robots have a power source all of these components work together to control how a robot operates throughout the history of robotics each of these components has improved vastly robots have been a long-standing trope in science fiction however by the 1960s they were actually becoming a reality the first real effort to build an autonomous machine that could move reason and act in its environment was the robot shaky brought to life in 1966 shaky is considered to be the world's first robot to embody artificial intelligence shaky could perceive its surroundings logically deduce implicit facts from explicit ones make a plan to achieve a goal monitor the execution of a plan in the real world and even correct its own errors shaky marked a new era in the age of robotics and computer science some of the algorithms used in robots and ai today have directly descended from shaky the area of robotics has evolved at breakneck speeds companies like boston dynamics are leading the charge creating robots that can almost move as well as you honda zasimo can learn independently walk on two legs and climb stairs toyota's thr-3 humanoid robot has been designed to fill a wide range of roles like cleaning construction caregiving or simple companionship thanks to these rapid developments in robotics building your own robot at home has never been easier you don't need that much there are extensive communities out there dedicated to those of you interested in creating your own intelligent machines when creating your own robot you first have to decide how it will be used is it simply for fun and amusement are you trying to enter the world of robot engineering or maybe you just want a robot for your desktop robot diy kits are available everywhere providing you with all the components and electronics you need the raspberry pi foundation has developed robot kits that can be used with the raspberry pi series to create your own mobile robot robotic arm or even a mini mars rover the lego mindstorm series is another excellent place to start if you or a younger family member is looking to get into robotics no matter where you are in your robot career there are a lot of options out there robots stand poised to upend many aspects of modern life and could eventually change the way we think about ourselves nonetheless at the moment robots are still very limited the movements actions and reasoning of a toddler still far exceed the capacity of some of the most advanced robots in the world nevertheless we could close that gap soon with some practice perhaps you will help engineer the next generation of robots"

        "transcript": "the idea of humanoid robots has been around for decades but with this ever evolving world this idea as of now is not just an idea I'm Chloe and you what's your name but reality stick around to the end of today's video as we talk about some fully functioning female robots released by Japan number 6. Grace Grace is a fully functioning humanoid robot nurse that was developed by Hanson robotics to assist doctors and medical staff during the covid-19 pandemic the pandemic demanded contactless care and Telehealth Solutions which at the time seemed impossible as medical procedures required contact to assist medical professionals in this Hanson robotics created Grace in 2021 Grace's Asian features color-length brown hair and skin made from unique material called thrabber which mimics the look and feel of human skin Grace has a thermal camera installed in the chest that helps in taking the patient's temperature and measuring his responsiveness with the help of artificial intelligence the fully functioning humanoid robots can diagnose a patient and is capable of communicating in English Mandarin and Cantonese I can do all kinds of things for elderly people I can visit people and brighten their day with social stimulation but I can also do talk therapy take bio readings and help health care providers assess their health and deliver treatments and do all kinds of things for elderly people take bio readings and help health care providers assess their health it has natural human-like features that make it comforting for the senior patients who feel scared or anxious during medical checkups Grace's state-of-the-art AI can help express emotions adding on to his human-like abilities CEO and founder of Hanson robotics David Hansen demonstrates these unique features of Grace that makes its interaction with humans more impactful hey Grace um why don't you look at my face and I'm going to show you a smile and let's see what your smile looks like okay yeah or sad oh yes reacting a little sad if I feel pain and there may maybe imagine a big loud noise happens number five Nadine Nadine is a guy Noida modeled on The Late computer scientist Professor Nadia magnanet falman for those of you who don't know what a gynoid is it is basically the female equivalent of Android robots just like Grace Nadine also has human resembling hair natural looking skin and realistic hands it is a gynoid social robot that is capable of interacting and communicating pretty well with humans whenever Nadine meets a human it greets them makes eye contact and responds well to their questions in several languages it is also capable of showing facial expressions and gestures adding to its interaction abilities Nadine has been programmed with the personality that allows it to change Expressions based on different responses he can express a total of 27 facial expressions and upper body movements that it uses to interact with humans it can also recognize previously interacted humans and record the conversations that God Nadine can assist individuals with special needs by reading them stories displaying images Etc Nadine is also the first humanoid robot to work as a customer service agent at AIA insurance company in Singapore it also entertained over 100 000 visitors during the human plus the future of our species Exhibition at the art science museum in Singapore if you think Nadine is impressive wait do you see Ada has to offer number 4. Ada just like Nadine Ada is another humanoid robot modeled on a human this time it is the late mathematician Ada Lovelace Ada Miller released Adar to the world in 2019 as a fully functioning humanoid robot capable of generating art the humanoid houses algorithms from computer graphics and artificial intelligence that allows it to make drawings paintings and sculptures using its mechanical alarms Ada caught the attention of the world during a public appearance when he drew a self-portrait using his robot arms and Camera the camera builds into Ada's eyes was programmed and developed by computer AI researchers at the University of Oxford and the drawing armored users was developed by undergraduate students from the University of Leeds to enhance his painting abilities Ada was equipped with a new painting arm in April 2022 that enabled it to paint using a pallet apart from just creating art Ada can respond to many questions through its way when asked whether a campaigned using imagination this was the response I like to paint what I can see you campaign from imagination I guess if you have an imagination I have been seeing different things to humans as I do not have consciousness number three giagia this one's special giaji is the first human-like robot that is nearly identical to a human being it is especially designed to follow every instruction given by the human fluidly it has a wider range of Expressions that it can use to communicate with humans it uses artificial intelligence to scan the person in front and communicate directly with them just like a human the unique thing about geogea is that it expresses more freely than other robots its eyes move freely all over the room is in and the lip movements are almost in sync with the words is speaking during the press conference some are from the audience tried taking a picture giagia responded don't come too close to me when you are taking a picture it will make my face look fat it took a total of three years for the team behind Giorgio to complete it but according to them the gynoid can be improved and updated for an improved model the team is hoping to fix and improve some features such as the hands they also want gsg's hands to look less like a mannequins are more like a real woman's hand gaju also likes Expressions which the team aims to add in the next model and hopes to make the humanoid more interactive with humans impressive isn't it but waiter you know about what Amica has to offer number 2. Amica next up is amaka amaka is a hyper realistic humanoid robot that truly showcases the potential of artificial intelligence it was created by a uk-based company named engineered Arts Amica has human-like facial features on body and is powered by a strong AI that allows it to communicate and interact freely with the humans just like humans Hamaker can change facial expressions and gestures according to the situation the unique thing about Amica is that its movements are more livelier than other robots the humanoid moves closer to a human which makes it feel realistic where most humanoids are limited to move their hands in the limited way Amaco can move his hands in multiple ways amica's shoulder movements are identical to those of humans it uses microphones binocular eye-mounted cameras a chess camera and facial recognition software to better interact with the audience these interactions can be monitored or controlled either using gpt3 or human telepresence to do those fluent human-like movements Amica has articulated motorized arms fingers neck and facial features amaka has gray rubber skin on the face and hands and is designed in such a way that it appears less genderless Amica has appeared at the Consumer Electronics Show 2022 Deutsch's Museum Nuremberg welcome to deutsche's museum Nuremberg omr Festival 2022 hosted by Vodafone and gitex 2022 it has now joined his fellow human employees at the Museum of the future in Dubai the visitors can interact with Amica and have a discussion with it number one Sophia you all must have heard about Sophia you know the first humanoid to be given Saudi Arabian citizenship no well don't worry because we'll be talking about it anyways Sophia is the elder sister of Grace the humanoid nurse we talked about a few minutes ago Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hanson robotics it was first activated on February the 14th 2016 and was revealed to the world in 2016 at South by Southwest in Austin Texas Sophia is modeled after Egyptian Queen Nefertiti British actress Audrey Hepburn David Hansen's wife Amanda Hansen the launch of Sophia has revolutionized the robot industry and it was one of the first humanoid robots that could actually interact with humans it uses microphones cameras and artificial intelligence to interact with humans and answer the questions over the years Sofia has attended various face-to-face meetings with leading figures around the world the human eye talked on various topics on several stages as a panel member and presenter at high level conferences ever since Sophia was first activated it is being constantly developed and improved to become a better version it is now able to imitate human gestures change facial expressions maintain a healthy discussion with humans and use data to evaluate its performance most importantly Sophia is now a public figure that attendsy Benson raises awareness of the future if you enjoyed this video video make sure to watch our video on why Boston Dynamics is building a super robot army"
