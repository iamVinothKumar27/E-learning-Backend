        "transcript": "hello everyone welcome to v2 e-sectional myself mr nitin kumar working as an assistant professor in department of computer science and engineering with the avatar college of engineering mysuru i am the course expert for mobile application development the subject code is 18 cs651 firstly i would like to thank the person who has framed this syllabus as an open elective why because the contents which are present in this particular syllabus it is completely correlated with the contents which are available in google for certification program so if we divide the syllabus so the syllabus consists of five modules out of those five modules the first two modules deals with activities and intents and the basic designs how to design the mobile application so the remaining three modules deals with how to publish an application what are the security features that you have to consider in your mobile applications while development along with that how to make use of databases and how to develop an interactive application that you're going to learn so totally five modules the contents which are present in this five modules will make the syllabus of associate android developer certification so if you are done with the contents of this five modules you can easily take up the certification examination that is provided by the google on android platform the certification name is associate android developer certification so which can be taken in two languages one is either in java or in kotlin as per your syllabus that is present in vtu so the subject is should be taught using java programming language coming to the subject my subject name is mobile application development and the code is 18cs651 so before we start with the what is development and other things firstly we should know what is mobile application what is mobile application so why because without knowing what is mobile applications so it is not possible to understand what is development so coming to this mobile application means nothing but the facebook instagram whatsapp the apps that you're going to use in your mobile such applications are called mobile applications don't feel that only the applications that you are going to use in your mobile mobile application even in your smart watches we can develop the mobile applications for smart watches we can develop the mobile application nowadays for automotive such as for example the sound system present in your car that's also in a mobile application and for example the nowadays the tv smart tv the name is android tv that will also make use of android so coming to this mobile application so it's nothing but the applications that you're going to develop for mobile devices are called mobile applications so we can divide this mobile applications into three categories the development developing the mobile application for your mobile devices is called mobile application development which can be categorized into three categories one is based on android one is completely based on android operating system android operating system it's nothing but a linux based operating system it's an open source other one is based on ios i guess you are well versed with this term ios why because ios is nothing but it is commonly used it is commonly used only in apple devices so next one is flutter these are the three ways or these are the three platforms that we have for developing the mobile applications so what is this android mobile application development means so android o mobile development means so where we are going to make use of a tool by name android studio by name android studio to develop the android application so if you develop the application by using this android studio men's so it will work only in your android devices the applications which are developed by using this android studio will be compatible only with the android devices similarly if you develop applications using ios means those application will be compatible only with the apple devices such as apple smart smartphones apple tabs so whatever the application that you are going to develop by using this ios platform which will be compatible with the apple devices so coming to this flutter so this is also called as an ibreed platform what is this hybrid platform is so whatever the applications that you're going to develop by using this flutter will be compatible both with the apple devices as well as android devices so coming to this up these are the frameworks that we are going to use android studio ios and flutter so which are all the languages why because framework is not a complete development tool framework is a tool that's it so inside the framework you have to make use of programming language to develop the applications so which are all the programming languages we need to use the programming languages that we are going to use for the android application development is java as well as kotlin so initially when i started working with this android in year 2016 it was completely java there was no kotlin at all so in 2020 this quarterly award so by 2023 google is giving a statement that they are going to completely remove this java and they are going to replace the kotlin for mobile application development but the thing is so the framework will remain the same just the change change that is happening here is only the programming language will change previously it was java now we have kotlin next down the line there might be some other user friendly programming language may arrive that we can use for the mobile application development the programming languages will keep on changing but the framework will remain the same the outcome of this subject is you must learn how to make use of this android studio don't worry about this program why because the programming languages will keep on changing but the framework will remain the same similarly with respect to ios devices the apple devices the programming language that we are going to use right now is shift the programming language that we are using is swift programming language we will use to develop the apple applications which will be compatible only with the ios devices coming to the programming language that we are going to use with respect to flutter is dart dart dart so if you develop what's the advantage of this flutter application means so whatever the application mobile application that you're going to develop using flutter will be compatible both with the ios as well as android os that's the advantage of flutter but as per your syllabus coming to confining to your syllabus these are the three ways you can develop the mobile application one this by using android other one is by using ios other one is by using flutter so if we confine your syllabus so as per your syllabus you must learn how to make use of android studio using java this is your complete syllabus the syllabus that is present in 18 cs651 deals with android studio using java programming language so why why i need to study this particular subject what's the importance what's the importance just if you understand just if you look at the global market so when i was a student so i need i i used to go to web applications i need to browse the web applications to get the required information or features but nowadays whatever the web applications are there for them the corresponding mobile app will be there in your google play store that indicates the importance of this subject so as the number of application increases the number of roles for the mobile application developer increases so if you know this mobile application development you can easily you can easily be industry ready so coming to this mobile application development how many users are there so if you consider 100 percent mobile person mobile users in world involved out of 100 71 percent users are android users 71 percent users are using android so in india if you consider this scenario in india 95 percent users are android users as i mentioned earlier there are only three flavors of mobile applications and three flavors of operating systems so android operating system and ios devices other than that we will have microsoft nokia lumia such devices and their market is very low so if you consider the world market out of 100 71 percent users are using android phones so in india especially in india 95 users are using android devices so remaining five percent of 3.2 percent belongs to apple users and remaining other like blackberry and uh by lawyers and microsoft users microsoft lumia nokia devices okay so this is the importance of this subject why because the graph is gradually growing initially in 2014 it was some presently now in india there are 1.1 billion users are there using smartphones so 1.1 billion users are using the mobile devices out of 1.1 billion users 700 700 million users are connected to internet means they are using smartphones out of 700 million users 95 percent users are based on android that's the importance of this subject why you need to learn this subject so forget it okay so i know only one programming language so just what's the importance of this subject so if you know this subject so you can survive anywhere in your in the industry why because this subject is having a huge scope though just analyze this market out of one 1.4 1.45 billion population 1.1 billion use population is using smart phones so out of those 1.1 billion 700 million phones are connected to the internet means they are using smartphones so out of 700 million 95 users are android based that's the importance of this subject that's why i conveyed thanks to the person who has framed this subject as an open elective so coming to this subject firstly i'm going to provide a brief overview on android application development why because as i mentioned earlier as i mentioned earlier so android application development so your subject completely confines towards the android application development using java so we can develop the android application in two ways one is by using java programming language other one is by using kotlin programming language as per the syllabus present so we have to use java in android studio the tool that we are going to use is android studio so firstly i'm going to brief the basic building blocks basic building blocks so of android so we have three basic building blocks in android so first one is activities first one is activities second one is intents third one is services so if you learn these three features if you learn if you are done with this basic building blocks of android you are done with your whole syllabus you are done with the whole syllabus of google associate android developer certification so i will take one by one so what is this basic building blocks we what is this activities intents and services so firstly basic building announcements so this all three together we will will make the mobile application using android there should be activities there should be intents there should be services these three put together will frame a mobile application what is this activities are so activity is nothing but a blank white sheet like this okay so it's an empty activity it's a blank white paper whatever you want you can design here i need a button i will place it i need a text to indicate my name i will place it whatever you want you can design in this blank paper such thing is called as an activity such thing is called activity so i if you are if you know about the web application so for example there might be 500 web pages 500 web pages together we call it as a website if you consider our video website there might be around thousand web pages together we call it as meet your website we do dot ac dot in similarly there might be n number of activities n number of activities together we call it as a single mobile application so please remember one thing one activity means it's nothing but a blank white sheet blank white sheet so where whatever the feature whatever the attribute whatever the widget that you want like button text box or whatever you want you are going to place inside that activity okay so such activities n number of activities together we call it as a single mobile application similarly how 500 web pages together we call it as a website so five consider 500 websites just assume 500 web pages are there in v2 website 500 web pages together we call it as a single website similarly n number of activities there might be 100 activities together we call it as a whatsapp application so if you just if you check your whatsapp application just you can uh check the scroll bar just in the navigation pane itself you can find the three option one is chart other one is message other one is status so chart itself is a separate activity status itself is a separate activity chart itself is a separate activity call itself is a separate activity just by clicking on the chat it will open the message related thing just by clicking on the status it will open the status just clicking on the call it will open the call means so you are transiting between the three activities like that android activities together call it as a single application there is no constraint that there might be any activities itself to make a single application you want a single activity we can we can call it as a single application but to serve the purpose we need more than one activity together we call it as a single mobile application just make sure that what is activity is nothing but a blank sheet blank white page where we are going to design our requirements so coming to this intent coming to this intense intents are nothing but user intentions user intentions what is that user intentions means user intentions so user intentions means just i don't know how many of you are watching this video or the users of facebook or instagram so in this facebook you will come across some news articles so if you click on that news articles it will ask the help of google chrome or opera mini browser to open that article that means so you are present in facebook application from the facebook application to complete that action you need another application by name google chrome so such kind of intentions or code as an user intentions there are two types of user intentions one is explicit other one is implicit these are the two types of intents which are present in android one is explicit other one is implicit what is this x plus it means what is this implicit means simple explicit means so if the communication is happening within the application if the communication is happening within your mobile app such intentions are called explicit intentions for example this is my whatsapp application where i have three tabs there are three steps one is chart other one is status other one is call so if i click on this call it will open the call related things which are present in your account that means you are not accessing the other application you are transiting from one activity to the this is my main activity this is my main page right this is what you're going to get when you open the whatsapp with three options chat status call so if i click on call it will open the activity the corresponding to call similarly if i click on status it will open the activity related to status means just absorb so there will be a back button if you click on this back button it will come back to the home page or main page main activity so here what i'm doing here i'm transiting between the two activities which are present inside the whatsapp application inside which application inside the whatsapp application this kind of transition is called as an explicit transition or explicit user intentions where the transition is going to happen within the application itself so what is the explicit between the two applications between the two applications for example consider your so your you have chat so i am the user i have sent one link v2 dot ac dot in so you will you will click on this message so if you click on this message your whatsapp doesn't have that feature to open its own browser so it will ask it will open a pop-up indicating whether you need to open it with google chrome other whether you need to open with opera mini so you if i select google chrome it will open the v2 website vtu dot ac dot in just observe your this is my whatsapp application from the whatsapp from the whatsapp application i am opening my google chrome this kind of intentions are called explicit intense make it simple explicit means if the transition is happening within the application means with whatever the application the time i am having i'm not transiting between the two application i'm transiting within my app for example in whatsapp how you're going to transit between the chat status and call options so implicit intents means so if you try to open a url it will ask the help of browser so it will be opened using the browser means your whatsapp application is making use of browser to complete the task such kind of intents are called implicit intents this is the second building block that we are going to use in our android application development or the term mobile application development so coming to the last building block that is nothing but services so please remember one thing with respect to services we have lot of already available services which is present in android studio just the thing is you must know how to use them you are not going to design something new just for example i need to create a database the sqlite service is already available we have sqlite just the thing is you must know how to use that sqlite in your mobile application development for example i need to create alarm application we have already have alarm service in this android studio just the thing is you must know how to use that alarm service so to create alarm application so for example i am going to use i am going to create a music player we already have a music applications which are running which are already present in the android studio just the thing is you must know how to make use of this kind of services okay that can be used in your mobile apps so this three put together will make any mobile application make it simple the syllabus is simple just the thing is what is activity whenever you're going to create a project whenever you're going to create application so it will open a blank page where you're going to design your requirements that's what we call activity so one activity will not make the mobile application n activities together we call it as a single mobile application what is intense it's nothing but user intention for example i am present in chat of whatsapp i need to go to status this kind of intentions are called explicit intents where you are going to transit within the application within the application implicit intents so for example if my friend has sent a url i will click on that url so it will ask to browser to complete the task such if that transition is happening between the application such intents are called implicit intents so next services the basic services which are required for any application development is already available in android studio just the thing is you must know how to use them that's it so whatever for example i need to create a text to speech application so which is already available text speech service is already available just you must know how to use that service what are the prerequisites what are the programming constructs that you need to use okay the function is already available just the thing is you must learn how to use them so before we start with the development make sure that so the basic requirements for using for developing android applications you must have a system with i5 r i7 configuration the device should be the device so to run the android studio the device requirement is you must have a mission with i5r i7 or greater along with that minimum 8gb ram minimum 8gb ram these are the device requirements to run android studio or to develop the mobile application so if you try with i3 processor devices with 4gb ram it's highly impossible to develop any android application the minimum requirement the minimum this is not the maximum one the minimum requirement means you must have a device with i5 plus or i5 or above processor with 8gb ram capability then only you can execute the android studio code or then only you can develop the mobile applications using the android studio the framework throughout our syllabus the framework that we are going to use is android studio and the language that we are going to use is java so the concepts that we are going to cover throughout our syllabuses activities intents and services so first two modules deals with the activities and intents so the remaining three modules deals with the services where you're going to learn how to create a database how to retrieve the data how to show share how to save the shared preferences how to publish an application how to develop an alarm like such things so you're going to learn in the remaining three modules this is the overview of the subject mobile application development with the subject code 18 cs 651 one as i mentioned earlier there are five modules present in your syllabus the subject name is mobile application development with subject code 18cs651 so coming to the module number one so you have five contents five topics that i am covering in this module are which are all the prices which are present in your syllabus the first is so introduction to what is android you are going to learn what is android what is versions why you need versions and what is android architecture that things you're going to learn in introduction to android followed by you're going to develop the first application you're going to build the first mobile application with hands-on experience next layout what is layout what is view what is the resources such things you are going to learn here how to make use of available layouts we have a wide variety of layouts which are readily available for the design purpose followed by event handling so for example i have added a button to my design so if i do some actions how that event will be handled how the actions will be recognized such things are discussed in this event handling followed by activities what's the life cycle of activity when the activity starts when the activity resumes when the activity is dead such things you're going to learn here followed by intents as i mentioned earlier in intense you are going to learn about two types of intense one as explicit other one is implicit finally so how to test our debug the mobile application this is the overview of the syllabus that is present in module number one starting with the what is android you're going to develop a simple application finally you're going to con we are going to conclude this particular module one with testing and debugging so coming to this android what is that android means why 90 percent of indians are using android mobile phones not the ios or other why in word out of 100 71 percent users are using android why because the android is an open source so even if you want to develop an application you can develop by using android studio and you can execute that application without any hurdles you don't need any high-end configuration systems or you don't want or you want to you don't want to purchase any license why because it's an open source so it it will be based on the linux kernel what is that linux kernel means so please remember one thing we have three flavors of operating systems we have three flavors of operating system one is linux kernel based that is nothing but open source linux kernel based isn't it open source one other one is windows third one is apple or ios we have three flavors of operating systems linux based windows based and ios based where the linux base is an open source that makes that's the added advantage or that makes this android studio famous so what is this android who invented this android so the android so initially the android was developed by andy rubin and team so there are four people's four members who worked on this android and developed this android studio our android application and you might be shocked why they have developed this so they have developed this for dg cameras digital cameras but it gained popularity when it was used in smartphones in year 2005 so this android is overtaken by google so from then onwards it's a product that comes under google corporation okay so that makes it's an open source that makes that's the great advantage of this android so user inter generally this android will be used in touch screens and smart devices so over 80 percent of smartphones all over the world makes use of this android operating system so please remember one thing android is not a name of mobile device android is a name of operating system which is based on the linux kernel okay so we have three flavors of operating system such as windows linux and ios out of those three flavors linux is an open source one so that will be used in the android okay initially it was developed by andy rubin and team in 2005 it was overtaken by google so from then onwards till 2022 it's a product android is the application our android studio is a product that comes under google corporation so that the applications which are developed for this android will cover watchers tvs cars so we have around 2 million android apps in google play store that shows the importance of this subject mobile application development it's not a theoretical subject it's a practical subject so where you are going to learn how to develop the mobile application the two the one framework which is which is the number one framework why because around 90 percent 95 percent of indian users are using that framework the name is android so over 2 million android applications are available in google play store this this shows the importance of this subject and highly customized devices and windows so please remember one thing the applications which are developed in android which can be easily customized there is no constraints such as for example if you want to develop an application for ios so you have to develop the application in apple device itself it's not possible to develop the application in some other device and deploy it to apple okay so such constraints are the restrictions which are not present in android devices as i mentioned earlier the main advantage why it has gained the popularity because of it is a open source one so coming to this android studio as i mentioned earlier what is android android is just an operating system what is this android studio it's nothing but it's nothing but a framework so throughout our syllabus throughout the five modules the framework that we are going to use is android studio what is this android studio it's the official android ide official android framework where by using this official android framework you can develop the android applications okay so what are the features that are provided in this android studio why it is uh it should be used for mobile application development for android os why because you can develop the application by using this android studio you can run the application you can debug and you can test and you can package the apps so these are the features which are available in this official android id and please remember one thing so just note my words so even you can develop the android application by using some platforms such as thunkable mit app inventor please remember that so where you are that's not a core android application so such applications will be developed by school students it will not serve the purpose you cannot customize such applications to develop application which can be customized you have to make use of android studio as i mentioned earlier it supports two programming languages such as java and kotlin along with the android studio please remember so in android studio there is no need if you want to see the output for example if you are executing a c program if you are executing a java so where you are going to see the output in the console similarly if you want to see the output of the application that you have developed so it will provide a feature by name virtual devices you can create create your virtual mobile device there itself and you can see the output there itself that's the advantage that's the main feature of android studio that is it provides the virtual devices you can create a virtual phone in that framework and you can observe the output there itself and you can visualize the layout for example i need to design something so the design visualization will be present here so the design layout will be presented as a feature these are the features of the framework that we are going to use on our throw out syllabus the framework that we are going to use is android studio that is an official id of android that comes under google the language that we are going to use is java so coming to the architecture so it's an important part android platform architecture what is this android platform architecture so please observe your where we have five layers five layers first layer is application layer first layer is application layer it's nothing but the applications will run in this layer for example just i will take a scenario if you consider whatsapp that comes under this first layer it's an application whatsapp is an application so there are two types of applications one is system application other one is user application whatever you are going to use whatever you are using whatsapp facebook chat or other applications such applications will come under user application system applications means for example settings have you installed anything to for settings to change the settings in your device no it's a system application for every individual phone there will be a settings that's a system application okay such kind of applications will be running on the first layer that's why we call that layer as application layer first layer is application layer where you will be having two types of application one is system application other one is user application user application means wide variety of applications you have that may be game that may be video player that may be music player that may be whatsapp facebook chat whatever that comes under user application system application mess which we which which we we have not installed which generally comes when you purchase the device such as such applications such as security manager power management settings such things are system application that's about the first layer system and user apps or you can call it as application layer so next layer number two java api framework as i mentioned earlier there are a lot of services lot of services which are readily available in the android studio that you must know how to use so your system applications will make use of those services will make use of those services such as notification manager alarm manager music player such services will be available in this java apa framework so your applications will make use of those services to complete the task so application framework layer is the layer which provides the support for the applications which are present in the application layer so it has been written using java programming language that's why we have using the term java api framework application programming interface framework so next we have the third layer where native libraries and android runtime so i don't know how many of you watching this video know about java to run the java code we will make use of java virtual machine that is nothing but jvm similarly to execute the android application to execute the mobile application we will make use of dalvik virtual machine dvm so that will be present here that support will be present for every individual application that you are going to develop the java android runtime will be provided it's nothing but dalvik virtual machine so similar to the jvm that we use in our java so native library supports will be there native library disappointments the of device drivers for example to work to work with the wi-fi connectivity have you installed anything no there should be a device driver should be installed in your device to have the connection with your wi-fi to connect to to make use of bluetooth there will be a bluetooth device device so to make use of a browser there should be webkit device driver so to make use of graphics there will be opengl such kind of drivers such kind of libraries will be returned using c and c plus plus that comes in the third layer along with the runtime runtime means it's nothing but dvm dalvik virtual machine so that's about the third layer first layer is about application second layer is about the support to the application such as various managers third layer is about the various libraries are the device drivers along with the android runtime it's nothing but dalvik course machine so next hardware abstraction layer what is this hardware abstraction layer so if you consider your device if you consider a mobile where we have camera where we have bluetooth where we have gps where we have ram where we have memory uh how those hardware parts will be utilized by your application by using this hardware abstraction layer how the ram usage will be happened in your mobile apps by using this hardware abstraction layer how your camera turns on when you click on the camera application by this hardware abstraction layer so this hardware abstraction layer is nothing but an interface between the hardware devices hardware components which are present in your mobile along with the application for example in my whatsapp i will click on camera icon it will turn on camera how based on this hardware obstruction layer camera itself is a separating component that is present in your mobile so whatsapp is application so whatsapp is present in top layer camera is is a physical component that is present in your device how it will be embedded how they are connected by using this hardware abstraction layer so finally linux kernel so this is the hard part of this four layers so what is going to do with this linux kernel it is going to perform various management such as performance management power management security management so why that's why we call this as a art part of your mobile app so if you divide these five layers first layer deals with applications so application can be categorized into two categories system applications and user application so next java api framework it's nothing but the various features of the services how your application can use those services so next native c plus plus library and android runtime c plus plus library means it's nothing but the device drivers which are required to make use of the features that are available in my phone along with the android runtime we are going to make use of dvm it's nothing but dalvik virtual machine so hardware abstraction layer as i mentioned earlier there might be wide variety of hardware components there might be different sensors or different components which will be available in your mobile how those components can be used by using this hardware abstraction layer your application can use those hardware components so the linux kernel it will be the art part of your android application so it which will perform various management such as power management memory management security management so those things will be taken control by this linux kernel this is the art part of this architecture so architecture can be divided into five layers as mentioned in this diagram so coming to versions so presently we are using android 12 as of as on 2022 the version that we are going to that we are using is android 12 so as per the syllabus as per the contents that is present in your syllabus so so firstly we started with honeycomb the version is 3.0 which was released in the year february 2011 next ice cream sandwich in october 2011 jelly bean in 12 2012. likewise we have wide variety of versions uh starting from 3.0 till 9.0 which is present in your syllabus so now we are using 12.0 okay so which is nothing but android p android r okay so what is this version sir why the key those people will keep on updating android versions so why because so if you don't update your android version means your device your smartphone or your smartwatch will not be compatible with the new application that going to emerge that's why you must update why because what are the some there might be some drawbacks or some failures or some missing features may be available in marshmallow which will be overcome by using nugget likewise they will keep on updating the android versions and unless until that reaches the saturation as of now it has not reached the saturation till the present version that we are using is android 12 so this is the api level so the minimum api level that we should now use in our devices is 28 or 29 so the minimum api level is 28 that you must have in your device while developing any application so these are the various versions the version started with anikum ice cream sandwich jelly bean kitkat lollipop marshmallow nugget oreo and pre so the presently using version is android 12 so now last with respect to this introduction this is the last topic that is what are the challenges that we will come across while developing the android applications first one is i guess you have seen new mobile up mobile phones where it is somewhat like a laptop where you can fold some mobile devices the screen orientation is big some mobile devices are screen as a screen orientation is very less so we need to your application the application that you are going to develop should accommodate this multi-screen world for example it might be a folding uh device or it may be straight or it may be horizontal it may be vertical so you cannot state that my application will work only for the devices with horizontal orientation my application will work only for the devices with four centimeter height six centimeter width such constraints you cannot find you cannot mention so your application the application that you're going to develop should fix that multi-screen world different devices with different screen orientation will appear but your application should fit that's the first challenge that appears while developing the android app development so next one getting the performance means the memory usage the power usage such thing should be considered while developing an application okay so your application should perform just i guess if you double if you open if your battery performance preferences in your devices it will show how many various applications have used your battery how consumed your battery power so such thing that thing should be considered why because i am running an application which consumes my 50 percent of battery means who is going to install your android app no one is going to use similarly keeping the code and user secure so this is the main main attribute out of out of this file that is so if someone is downloading your application someone is using your android app means they should be secure why because nowadays we are doing a transaction over our mobile phones using various uh uh applications such as phone pay google pay amazon pay okay so if the data or the transaction details are the details which are present in our mobile phone or the contact details or the multimedia details are fetched by my application means that will be a threat so please remember one thing the users the viewers who are we watching this video kindly download any mobile application for example if you are using android applications means android phones kindly download only the applications which are available in google play store so only for such application the security checks are being done for remaining application don't don't download or don't install any application directly in the form of apk file so that may help your device as well as that may get the data that is present in your device finally it should be compatible for example i am developing an application for nowaday advanced android 12 but it should be compatible with the previous version marshmallow or kitkat lollipop so you should you should not ignore the previous versions even you have to consider the previous version and you have to update the features to be compatible with the present version that's also one challenge whatever the application that you are going to develop should be compatible with the world users so finally understanding the market and the users as i mentioned earlier present the global market for mobile application is wonderful guys so 95 percent indians are using the smartphones okay so especially 95 smartphones with android operating system so this subject this subject will have a huge weightage and will be will be a great asset why because 95 percent users who are using smartphones are android based means just imagine how many applications will have all how many jobs will be created so that's the market of android applications presently in india with respect to world concerns 71 percent users are android based thank you [Music]"

        "transcript": "hello welcome today we'll start with the first chapter introduction to mobile applications development and Android we will cover the introduction to mobile including devices and application development we'll get to know a little bit about the history and evolution of mobile and also brief introduction to Android mobility is defined to be having the capability of being able to move or to be moved easily it is very important to get things moved easily therefore in order to get things move easily there are certain properties to mobile devices and these are what causing mobile application development to be slightly different compared to traditional applications writing on desktop based systems mobile devices are started to be commercialized in 1983 and this is how a mobile device look like back then it's very expensive heavy and very basic it only allows you to make calls and receive calls but as time continues to progress we see more interesting aspect added into the phones including text messages we have music and then we have simple applications today we are going into a smartphone era where mobile applications become more and more important and is easier for us to actually obtain various types of applications to get various types of job done besides that is also possible to actually have various type of mobile devices they're not just a phone this includes tablets music players cameras watches and of a wide variety of possible devices that can be programmed to be small light and portable generally there are some characteristic to mobility first is portability the most important aspect is that one can easily carry the device and bring it all around the place therefore the size and the weight of the device is usually small this is very important because it will affect the actual characteristics of the devices and also giving challenges to the developers in terms of writing applications that can work on such small devices besides that usability is also very important the mobile device should be usable by different type of people in different type of environments they should not be restricted to be used at only a certain location or certain setting but it can be useful all over the place they can be affected by use of characteristics environmental critics and device for a statistics functionality is also very important for the mobile devices mobile applications can provide functions so that they are such functionalities running on the mobile devices that the user can use it to get certain job done these mobile applications can be standalone and could also dependent on other systems or other users connectability is a very important part that makes mobile devices great the capability to connect to a different device distance away is very important there are three modes of connectivity one that allows connection to the back-end system all the time one that will connect to the back-end system intermittently throughout the period duration and one that never connects to use the back-end system therefore can be working totally offline and our mobile devices have certain features in general first for the processor is definitely going to be slower compared to any desktop devices that is actually being launched in the same time the main reason is to conserve battery power because of the size of the battery due to portability the processor cannot be too fast because it will be two batteries and some the battery consuming and therefore would not last long therefore processor speed is usually controlled to be lower than the average PCs or desktops in the past the processor speed can be extremely small but now most of the process has been a lot more decent and allowing a lot of tasks to be conducted in a much more normal manner and a more acceptable speed next is the operating system the operating systems in mobile devices are different compared to the standard operating systems that we use in desktop systems they are specifically designed to be used on mobile devices popular operating system in mobile includes Android iOS Windows Mobile which are the three players the display is also small because of the size of the device and some cheaper phones and cheaper mobile devices can have less powerful displays the memory size is also small it can go down to a few hundred kilobytes for some very basic devices up to a few gigabytes but generally not as good as what we get in desktops where we have a much higher maximum ram that we can add in the input is also made more challenged because of the size due to the smaller size we do not have a sophisticated keyboard or mouse and etc some of the devices may be designed to have a small keyboard that is physically attached to the device but due to the device size the keyboard is very small however this is not popular nowadays and most of them resort to using on-screen keypads cell phones smartphones that we have nowadays are generally using touchscreen as their input and therefore most of this typing are done using these small on-screen keyboard that is made available on the touchscreen some will use handwriting recognition system to help assist writing more complicated characters such as Chinese Korean Japanese Hindi and other scripts that are a little bit more difficult to type voice input were also more popular compared to desktop applications to help assist in easier input mobile devices generally have a mean to connect to different type of networks and there are a few ways of connection including Wi-Fi 3G 4G and etc according to devices for extensibility of mobile devices they can be designed to have additional memory files modems cameras GPS however it depends on the mobile device itself during design phase and after that is quite difficult to custom-made an actual device according to users need so most of these are pre-designed but it is free for the manufacturers to control what to be added into a device during the design phase the price can be highly variable depending on the specifications of these device so it can be very cheap and very basic to very expensive phones with very good features and also very good specifications for the wireless networks it first started to be developed by Bell Labs advanced mobile phone services were designed back then but today most of us are using the global system for mobile communication gsm for our basic basic services that are provided by the service providers for receiving calls and also to make calls the basic way to connect to internet on mobile devices is to use the GPRS general packet radio service this is highly available throughout most regions and even in certain areas they are very rural or even in forested areas although signals could be unstable in very remote areas this is a very slow connection but at least a basic one that allows us to connect to internet when there are no better technology why then wipe and CDMA provides us 3G technology and these definitely increases the data transmission rate and is widely available in most major cities and larger towns today and this is one of the most important basic technology for us to connect an Internet in most urban and suburban areas there are some other wireless technologies and 4G technology is one of the most important technology that we are looking at today for basic mobile networking that we are using in a lot of larger cities this is a comparison of roughly where are the speed limits of the different technology 4G including LTE can actually theoretically go up to 1 Gbps there are different types of fields in mobile that we can actually try to classify a lot of these are duplicated with one another and overlapping so the first term that we often hear is mobile computing mobile computing allows us to have devices being programmed to be functioning and they are allowed to be move around so most of other phones that we are seeing today can be considered as a mobile computing device it allows actions to be done that are actually computed and you can use it in different locations as you bring the device along we also see anywhere anytime information this is the idea that allows us to get information wherever we go and with the basic connection that we have nowadays it is possible for us to obtain these thought of information as long as we are connected to the Internet the virtual home environment allows us to experience network that is similar to a home network a whole network usually have fixed IP so when we are moving around as we move our connection may be connected to different mobile mobile services tower and we did not experience the shift of this kind of connection and we will feel that we are always connected to a same connection and this is the most important part of mobile devices that allows us to experience such a kind of it network experience that is similar to where we are at a home or office environment and other type of fields and some of the important ones that we are seeing includes pervasive computing pervasive computing is getting important because we are seeing more and more technology going to be more pervasive in a way such as they are appearing in our cars it can appear in our clothing it can appear in some chairs tables and different common objects around us when this kind of pervasive computer"

        "transcript": "Welcome you new era of Android app development and now we will become \"Android Kay Champion\" Guys Mobile apps are more useable than websites. If you don't believe then here I ask a question that when was the last time you went to facebook.com and used Facebook? Here, let me ask another question whether you last used Facebook through website or mobile app, then the answer given by most of the students here will be mobile apps because in today's time more people use internet, mobile phone. If the internet goes down then the website closes at that very moment and we do not get to see any information on the internet. On the other hand, if we talk about the app, we are simply using it inside the phone. The things are already loaded, so we can easily see them even after going to the internet, after that there are some books, after that there is a recipe app or something similar to it, it starts mostly offline, so we can access it through the app. All information can be easily accessed. On average, if we see that a person spends 3 hours and 15 minutes a day on a mobile phone and on an average, a person checks his phone 58 times a day again and again and every One in every mobile phone user spends four to 4.5 hours on the mobile phone and you will be surprised to hear that on weekends, humans use less phones. Aaj compare tu week des [Music] To gas if the audios of the smartphone are seen. So it is very much and people use the phone regularly. Now we have two options here that they should not use this mobile phone, time is wasted on the mobile phone, after that the ice gets spoiled and blah blah while others. On the number here, we can see it as an opportunity that the more people are calling it, then we will create such a thing that if people start using our app, then why not we can benefit through that and we If we can earn good money then here we are going to see it further as a developer, so we are going to count this thing above, at this time if we look at the whole world then there is eight billing population whereas there are 6.6 billion smartphones in this world. If you exist in India, then gas here, if you target even one million audience according to you, then you can easily reach 10 thousand dollars from Punch, so if you want to see this as an opportunity here, then gas all this fund. To understand, we have launched Android App Development Course Using Kota Clean, so in this video we will see what types of mobile apps are there, why do we need mobile apps, the types of mobile apps that we will see are also on user end. We will also see the developer end pay, after that here we will also understand the difference between native app and hybrid apps and after that here we are going to do native development, so we will also see the benefits of native app development in detail, after that we will look at the career options. We will see whether it has any scope or not, if there is salary then how much can it be, then the first topic here is that we need mobile apps. In today's time, mostly people access the internet through smartphones. And whatever we are doing on the mobile phone, we are doing the same to the apps. Mobile apps provide easy and functional access to information, products and services to the users, which means whatever we need on the internet, it is there. Simply on our single click we go with the help of mobile app, so here I have given three words to it - information products and thirdly, it is services, so first let us know a little about them because knowing about these three is important here . This is going to be very important, so the first point that we will understand here is information, so humans are always interested in knowing about new things. For example, if I am on YouTube, then I have to create the setup of YouTube. I need to know that this You will get this at the rate of the mic, this is the stand for the mic, where will you get it, there is computer lighting, here if you see, this color is ok, then where will you get this, so if you want to know about all these things, then first of all I If I Google this app, I will get a lot of information from it. If you are a student then you have to do it in April or if you want to create a website then you should have a computer or laptop. Now you have to know which laptop or laptop I have. If I want to buy a computer, which mail will be right, then for that also it is a simple thing, you will just do Google, after that if you want to do any course, then it is a simple thing, you will go to Coursera and fly to it or you will do some other household work. Yes, it's a simple thing That too, if you search on the internet, then people may watch its tutorial, you may find it on YouTube itself, then we come to know that if we need any information, then for that we have to use the mobile app, so here The second point is the powder, before this we have got information about the help of YouTube, we need a mic, we need a camera, we need a computer, we need lighting, so these are all the products, now we have to buy these products. So for that we can go to Amazon or Flipkart. If you also have to buy anything in the same way, then you are ordering it through some or the other mobile app. After that, the third thing is services. There are many types of services in the services. For example, if you look at these apps like Ola, Uber, Zomato, they are providing services. Similarly, if you are a freelancer, you are also providing services, then for this also you would be using some mobile or Facebook. Yes, why do we need mobile apps? Let us take some examples from our daily life. In the morning, when we are sleeping, the world is also an alarm for us, the alarm is also a mobile app and when we sleep, YouTube is for us. It is telling that brother, go to sleep now, it is time for you to sleep. YouTube is also an app, so now let us see in a little more detail which mobile apps we use from morning to evening. Let's take it and on her wedding night, if you are a businessman or a student, then now let us know a little about which apps you use to do it, then the gas starting is happening with your own comfort, that means saliva has given us the place. So after that we have to do communication in a day, so for that we will do WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram, we can do Zoom, we can do Skype for meetings, so for communication right now we are here. For socializing, we use more mobile apps. Now we use mobile apps because now after Covid, if seen, more people are more proud. So for that we use LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok. And I don't want to say it but people also use dating apps, so gas is there, now I talked about Instagram, WhatsApp and many other social media apps, so we have to store their status and download videos too, so gas is there for all these. For this we have uploaded an app on Play Store regarding My Status Ever, you can download it and you can download everything quick quick quick if you have to go to school, go to university, go to college or go to your relative's house. So then you will do it on Google Map, now only in free time, if you have something to do, now for that also we read some book or we play games etc. Mostly we are studying online for education. When we go to university or college, we get apps from their portals etc. for registration, there too there is less mobile app, after that humans also need some entertainment, so for internet we use YouTube for that. There are some music apps, we do that, we watch gym tutorials, we get apps, we get life hacks, if you want to watch something then YouTube, you will do it, if there is any window for example, you have to crack it because mostly people do not do the original, it is okay. You should do the original thing but its tutorial group is also on YouTube. If you are hungry then you want to eat fast food then it is a simple thing, you will go to Foodpanda if you want to eat desi food which is your favorite restaurant. So they must have some mobile app on which you can order. If you are an organized person then you will also have some todo app on which you can scrutinize your meetings. You can also make a time table, after that if You are a calculated person, meaning if you have a job , you have a fixed salary, so you have to spend your entire month within it, so for that you download some account type apps. If you are a poster student. If yes, then your experience will be very good because there is a lot of need for calculation. If you are a business owner, if you have to track your employers, then you should know how much of your items are in the inventory and which ones are out of the inventory. Which item is being bought, i.e. which sale is taking place, after that we have to give a receipt to the customer, all this is now done only through mobile apps. If you are an investor, then also you can use mobile apps. You do it because you have kept all your portfolio at one place, for that we get different apps on Play Store. If you invest in crypto, then you must know about finance, about coin base. You must be aware of many more things from the mobile app, from which I come to know that whatever we are doing almost has a role of mobile app in it, it plays a role at some place or the other, not only this, if you are religious then there is no When a religious event is about to take place, you also get a reminder from the app itself. In the matter of gas, we come to know that whatever we are doing in our daily life, our Sam is actually reading from some app or the other. Even if we are walking, all the steps we are taking are also being calculated, so as long as the mobile app will continue to be there, it is the scope of the mobile app developer, so gas, this video was getting quite long, so it The next topic that you are going to get, you will get it at this place. In this video, we will cover the types of mobile apps and will also know about native and hybrid apps in detail. This much is available in this video. Next in the video. Till then take care with the topic and thanks for watching needs"

        "transcript": "[Music] so today we have christian muru he'll be taking us through android ios platform which which is which any questions we have he'll be taking us through all those things so i think i can now welcome christian to continue he is a software developer at codex for africa and also a cto at ventures yeah christian um i'm christian moro i'm a software developer so at college africa and the cgi adventures so today we're going to talk about android ios and cross-platform mobile application development so we are on reaches so i think uh it's pleasure you guys to be on board today with you and i'm actually glad for the host and all the organizers so let's go to the mobile development platforms so actually we have native that's ios so ios we can do objective c or swift then we have android android not necessarily java but you can do android actually with c plus plus you can do android with golang you can do android with flutter depending on your preference but also there is for windows phone that's c hash and xaml so for web there is those the normal languages that we all know that's html5 etc has written on the presentation so we have the hybrid and the cross platform but um i'm going to that quickly on the android so like for android there are different applications that are going to run maybe it's a web app or it's going to run on the play store so we can have like a simple app that has home contacts phone and browser etc but also there are number of application frameworks that you can use like the activity manager telephony manager resource manager content providers location etc there are very many actually but also it's good to know the libraries that you can use in your android development so we have the surface manager the free type ssl sgl opens hello okay so yeah those are libraries and we also have the linux kernel for those who are beginners perhaps they could have gone through about the linux scanner that linux kernel actually it's got like when somebody or a user is installing that application for android you can ask you maybe to access your camera your contacts it will ask you maybe even to access your and message messages etc so all those they're done on the linux scanner like when you see an application like uber can access your location can access your you can access your contacts etc your camera as well so you can imagine like let's say loan applications those are android ones like um tala actually they will access mobile phone contracts they will access your location etc because they'll need to know where you are at at a point that you haven't paid your loan in advance that's why now they can send contacts because they are already you have given them access to your mobile contacts okay so we have the power management etc okay i think we are good to go actually um guys uh this session i i really i really love it to be an interactive session whereas you guys will be asking me questions as well as i'll be answering to you and if i have any other question for you guys you can come back and answer me okay so let's go to the cross platform so actually uh there's that way which you need now to build a high quality native apps so it's not very hard actually but it depends on how you're going to use it so the alternatives for your [Music] across platform could be native script react native zamarin you can even use kotlin you can use java etc depending on your preference so um on the cross platforms guys we have different frameworks that are used to build cross-platform applications so we have like jquery that's mobile app mobi marmalade titanium phone gap essential accenture monocross we have more thing i build up even mit can do that i hope guys we're together so um is there anyone maybe with any question perhaps at that point as i continue right quietness means that we are flowing well all right so let's go to the native script so actually it's around time for building and running magic ios android and soon windows phone apps with a single javascript code base so actually it depends on how you're going to use it so um let's see on the features so it's created and supported by generic fully open source actually yeah native speakers and open source so it uses v8 on android and javascript core on ios engines it uses existing js and css xml html skills it also uses es6 and track script and angular restricted css support first public better releases so that was it's better so uh the first and let's say the genesis of native script it started on the uh fifth of march 2015 that was so it was version one i'm now back so i was talking about the native script and uh we're actually getting to know about native script and how it goes so i said it's a random for building and running native ios android and soon windows phone apps with single javascript code base that is so it was created and supported by telerik that's the genesis of native script so it uses v8 on android and javascript called ios engines it uses existing gis and the css xml or html skills but again there is genesis weight so it started on 5th of march 2015 that was when it released a better one a better release that is version one okay so let's go to react native let's get to know it so red native lets you build mobile apps using only javascript it uses the same design as react letting you compose a rich mobile ui and declarative components so this is the point whereas by each it actually gives you an interactive interface whereas by maybe a user can interact with it very well and quickly without any contradictions in between it so it's up an open source javascript library the react native so it's actually an open system for javascript libraries and as you know there are a number of libraries actually which are coming from a certain language like react comes from javascript we have now denon which is coming from like it's a daughter from node.js we again have a next js which comes from vjs so actually the number of i mean a number of libraries that coming from specific javascript not javascript but a library a specific languages that is so the facebook ad manager on ios and android that share 85 percent of the code so it depends but now we can see red native it actually grows perpetually and we like have 500 plus companies and developer who publishes up on apple app store using react native so actually reg native is also one of the flaming languages that we have is currently in the industry so we again have xamarin actually submarine it uses the dotnet framework and as we all know we've talked about the libraries that are ref native which is a javascript library and um submarine is a donate dot net library whereas by it also uses flutter flatter also uses the dot net so the marine brings open source they don't need to mobile development enabling every developer to build truly native apps for any device in c hash and f so if hash that's flat up i hope you get me guys there anyone with any question okay uh the mute means that we are flowing well right so let's go to the xamarin architecture choices so um as we said is that i'm going to speak about android ios and cross platform so we can see on the ios may be using ch user interface on the android exam and windows same way so it actually shares the same apology so like um let's say like for example they have used c hash but they're another long there's another language like flutter flutter actually it has um let's use the interface and actually it uses the net framework as well and it can work on both android and ios and actually after you guys have learned java on android you'll find it more easy when you learn when you'll find it more easy when you learn flatter because flat actually it's got a lot of framework and it's very quick and without a lot of chords so actually when you use flat and you it's only be the golang and quarantines it will be very quick for you guys but again that those who love using kotlin and java only for android especially the beginners you know they normally flow from coach lane and java which is okay right but also we have the xamarin phones uh so they also use uh shared app logic as well but xamarin ios and xml android they have like 60 to 80 percent code reuse so like it's like let's say you have used xamarin on your android when you're moving to ios app development i you will definitely not add some tons of codes but you will only add like 20 percent of the xamarin codes to fit you in the ios app development i hope guys you get me actually i wrote the recommend the recommended so it's actually recommended for sophisticated ux app that's user experienced up is anyone asking questions okay so we uh we have summary informs as i said is that they're also they also share up logic but up to 99 percent code reuse so actually xamarin forms it it uses lag largest code reuse that is 99 and actually it's most recommended for forms based lob apps okay so let's go for xamarin under the hood so that's uh let's go on the ios architecture that is so ios that's when you have your app as we i previously said on the android part is thereby it uses the car name but now here this one um it uses the your app rpa whereby in ios you use swift at most like in android you'll develop your android application using android studio but actually on the ios you definitely use swift then now you decide to use maybe code igniter you can use xamarin you can use react native flat as well whereby now you you won't have to add some tons of code if you have uh developed that application from android i hope guys you get like let's say uber for example i'm using um mainly uber because i know they are popular applications that they are around and actually their users keeping on flaming each day and out so um let's say uber they they have the same ux and their ui actually looks similar from android to ios so actually it's just the same way so what they use there the up the app logic is just the same way they used on the ios as well so they just added very little codes like maybe 20 to 30 percent from what they were developing from android okay so actually on ios they have also the swift is like unix like canal for those who have been interacting with fifth but uh it actually uses a full aot monorantine so you can either use it you can build ios up using ci or dot net appears so dot net api is there a lot actually you can use flutter.net you can use c-hash.net etc there are a lot actually okay so we're still in the xamarin under the hood so let's go to the android architecture now so this is where now you take the dot net apis now you go to the android binding after you have done with the binding you now go to the android that's where now you start building your application so maybe you can build you up now with java like i said in the ios that i used an example of c hash for example but flutter works from both and actually as i said is that flat is one of the flaming languages that's coming up and anyway it's supported with google as well okay so um now you go to the java after there now you do the art once you have you have your ad an ad actually it's an idea about what you want to develop like maybe you are developing an application that you will use would be used to sell motor vehicles etc but again now you go to the acw now those are the procedures or the journey towards android application using xamarin actually so from mcw you go to scw then mono and all of them they use linux kernel so as i said is that linux kernel is what gives the users uh permissions so the user before installing application it will ask him or her some permissions perhaps like to access phone camera messages from contracts etc etc yeah that's it so let's do a quick comparison i actually decided to do this this comparison because it's quite good actually and very logic in debugging your application now so i just used native script react native and xamarin all of these they're actually the dotnet frameworks but also flutter is a dot-net framework so let's go like debugging on emulator so um native script and you can debug it on emulator react native yes you can debug it on the emulator xamarin of course yes native rest native native native script you can debug it on device you can debug it on react native again native script sorry you can debug it on the device react narrative you can debug it on the device as well zamarin you can debug it on the device uh but also there is this remote uh debugging like for native uh native script yeah you can you can do its debugging uh remotely using the link that is just sent there so you just debug it from there react native as well you can debug it uh that's a sample there from facebook and also xamarin you can't so xamarin you can do remote debugging for it and let's go to live reload now when you want to reload your application let's say now so with the native script you can reload the application with react native of course you can live reload it and with xamarin you can but only in xaml because xml previewer for xamarin.forms alpha that is i hope you guys get me right anyone with any question perhaps as we continue okay i'm happy guys i hope um we are all flowing well we are all flowing well no questions okay let me get done then uh i'll be getting back to the questions okay so let's go now to the comparison about the features now because now we are done with the comparison on the debugging that is um android ios and cross platform so we are now going to compare the features so like native script on the ios version support io7 that is but actually now we are even on the ios 10 which is the latest release that is so io7 or greater and xcode version 3 than 6 on the rec native it does on the ios 8.0 plus and then xamarin it does on ios 6.1 or high we also have native script which on the main android version support it does on the 17 version 4.2 which also on the react native it does on the android on the version 4.1 plus that is an api 16 also we can go to xamarin which it does on the android 4.0 0.3 that's api 15 or higher again we have native script that is on windows phone support so native skill um that time it was not yet but now they were actually working towards having it working on the android phone uh rec native official not microsoft community supported but some are in its is a native script so let's say the features that it supports like camera sensors touch id iris etc so it does on the camera location and plugins recognitive it does on the camera location plugins as well and xamarin does camera location and some xamarin plugin actually there are several there are a number of them so let's go to the native map support on the mapping now like um i don't know but i keep repeating about uber because it uses maps as well so i think it's a good epitome for our case yeah so uber it actually uses um a native maps that's when you get a driver gets to know your location and then it comes to pick you up right so erect native of course it's is it has some native map and xamarin of course it's is i hope you guys understand me okay comparison now on the deployment so we have done a comparison on the debugging comparison of the features and now we're going to the comparison on the deployment so we have the native script we are still comparing native script react native and xamarin so native script that's for android direct native ios submarine for cross platform so automated tests yes it does some automated tests you can you you can check some uh samples on those links that hit gps docs.nativescape.org for slash tooling for slash testing so we have some automated test that rpm you can get it at https forward slash github.com vs native script uh we have rec native yes it does the automatic test on the link below our screen you can find it there xamarin as well it does but not your script on the deployment without market it doesn't recognize if it does xamarin doesn't as well um native script on the easy deployment and continuous integration that is you keep on integrating some more features etc so of course it does so all of them native script react native and xamarin they allow you to do some extra more deployments like let's say now you have deployed your application you want to update it from version one that maybe you are the better version now you've started it and you want now to take it to version two etc you're going or maybe 1.1 etc the way you might prefer it okay then we have the packet side that's apk and that's maybe 21.8 mega mega megabytes on android and bandwidth with webpack we have an app ipa with 39.9 mbs that's on iphone and bandwidth webpack apk so it's they actually keep on fluctuating so we have also apk on rec 90 we have apk 8.47 on android and ipa 7.5 mb on iphone so that's how they keep on interchanging and i as i said is that while you coded maybe you've programmed your android application and now you're going to ios maybe android you would have used a 60 of your code now you only have to add some twenty percent of the sixty percent so that you program it to be an ios application as well with the same features the same ui and just the same ads etc okay so xamarin in apk 16 mb's on android and up 46.4 mb's on ios that's it um this actually an error here so i'm sorry guys i think i'm coming to my conclusion so i'm christian moore those are my contacts that's my email i have a number of mails guys but uh you can use any else you can accept me or call me at that contact if you need me to share more i also share more resources from pluralsight anyway um i uh i mentor the google africa developer scholarship 2020 learners so i have those resources as well and also i declared some more resources from proverbs 8 recently where i keep on sharing them especially on the codextra whatsapp platform for kenya that is thank you very much guys and stay in touch i'm ready to listen from you i think i've taken 35 minutes for the next 25 or maybe 10 let's let me get to hear from you guys yes thank you so much i have a question yes please since this is like an introduction an introductory session on all the different types so do you have maybe any resources how did you even start into first place even into mobile development you have like plans okay yeah of course so um i have i have i have like tons of resources um from pluralsight for mobile web specialists android app and jquery and react for ios as well i got them for swift so actually i prefer pluralsight proceed have some very nice uh very nice resources for you guys to learn yeah actually pro site can do better but also you can learn like let's say now you want to learn a you can you can type developers.google.com so you just search that http www.developers.google.com that you will actually find some quite good stuff there to learn for free like a lot of resources for you guys to learn on development and actually flutter as i said is that it's actually good because it works on android ios and cross platform yeah any other question please [Music] please can you hear me we hear you man i can't be kindly while asking your question please tell me your name um i'm calling and uh i have a question how how did you get to specify because like choose the platform now sorry sorry collins i can't hear you well i just told you about uh just your name and introduction brief introduction finally come again what [Music] what made you choose it the rest okay okay nice i will say thank you collins for your questions actually that's a nice question for me um actually guys uh learning is actually a continuous process and i simply started from the very common and regular used language html css forever that that's the language which people use it and i specified on html css javascript and php long time ago a bit so thereafter now i went deep to react once i went to react now i decided to do an android application as well using react and thereafter now i decided to use the code igniter on my android part so on the amount of using react that's when now i shifted to the ios so ios i also use the react native and it took me well but now i just came to realize about flutter oh wow so this flutter it's like i'm falling in love with it because i just caught with it and i love it this flutter i just like its ui so it's a matter of you doing one language you master it ensure that what you can build with c hash you can as well build it with c plus ensure what you can build it with react on web you can actually build it on android application as well and be sure of yourself that's what most needed of you the number of resources for you to learn you can go to um pluralsight free code.com um especially during this time you can go to um solo land et cetera there are a lot there are a lot there a lot and actually codextra we're working towards giving some more free learning uh resources a few such skills www.skills.codextra africa.com you will be able to see what we are currently developing yeah okay thank you welcome collins any other questions [Music] i'm not sure if you have any other questions [Music] so we have we have a guest it's called jeremiah jeremiah can you meet yourself and tell us and if you have any question or anything on your mind or we'll get into the session and can you kindly recommend for the best ide for the beginner who can want to develop the android apps [Music] hey i don't feel like recommending for you guys but you can use any id as long as it meets your letter your specification it actually depends it's the matter of you while you are developing your app and what about android studio it's calling again if he wants to develop an android app isn't android studio one of the best developers like development for the development ideas for android actually ids are a lot we have android studio but actually android studio is what it's currently being used a lot and it's very nice there's also eclipse apache cordova we have up inventor for android we have eclipse qt so qt actually uses mostly python for those who are python developers also there is windows app studio but all these just came on the way me i just looked at them but i i got rid of them i just went to android studio so till today i just used android studio you hello jeremiah i actually yeah okay if you're using java i can recommend for you android studio android studio can be of great help for you especially on your ide yeah it's actually the best idea for that okay thank you welcome welcome thank you so much for that so i'll call out one of the last person before we end or if you have if you have any questions you can understand with yourself so maybe i can call on to cindy um [Music] wrap up [Music] um what i can say or an advice to any developer currently is that you guys learn how to speak on one language don't just come here about a new language like now there's amber a lot of languages just are popping up they know js so like guys are just popping up a swear rush to those new languages no just stick to one language just stay tuned get to know it very well don't mix up languages so that you become self-sufficient with one language first then you go to another one that's my advice to all developers and cheers guys thanks for coming [Music] [Music] you"

        "transcript": "meet Adam an aspiring entrepreneur he is interested in hosting an online store for home decor products like bases curtains artwork and Home Furnishings he requires a software application that would allow the customers to browse the available products at their fingertips and buy them online Adam eager to jump into his new business wanted to understand how the software development process works to start with his business idea Adam meets his cousin Mark who is a software developer and a good one at it he pitches his idea and asks his cousin to help him design an online business application Mark explains to Adam the way of Designing the best online shopping application we need to understand the working of the software development lifecycle also known as the sdlc it involves distinctive phases to initiate the software production based on the client requirements further Mark briefs Adam about the six crucial phases of sdlc in designing any software application planning requirements phase requirement analysis phase designing phase implementation phase testing phase deployment and maintenance phase the development team will commence production post agreeing on the terms and conditions discussed between the client and the development team regarding all the proceedings and requirements initiating the production with the planning requirements phase where the client and the development team will discuss the basic requirements for the software like the purpose of the application the details about the end user of the product key elements like format and attributes of the application for Designing and the overall user interface's design of the software the development moves on to the second stage the requirement analysis phase which includes the detailed information about each element to design the software is discussed validating the installation of elements in the application according to the client's requirements calibrating the security protocols and Performing risk analysis for the software application and all the discussed details are then to be filed in the software requirements specification document also known as the SRS document after completing the second phase third stage of software development the design phase the software designers will devise the system design following the SRS document the system design defines the overall architecture of the software and checks its feasibility with the client's requirements all the details of the design phase are added to the design document specification also known as the DDS document and shared with the analysts and stakeholders for review next the development moves on to the fourth stage the coding or implementation phase in the coding phase the developers start writing the code using the languages they choose for the software development the coding stage is also one of the most important phases as it encapsulates the implementation of the software product the developers use predefined guidelines and development tools like compilers and debuggers to implement the code the next phase of the production is where we begin with the fifth stage of software development the testing phase the develop software is now deployed in multiple test environments to check the functioning of all the attributes in the software architecture after the test cases are completed the quality assurance and the testing team may find errors or bugs in the software which will be forwarded to the developer team for debugging this testing and debugging process continues until the software is stable and works per the required specifications as for the last stage in the sdlc life cycle the deployment and maintenance phase is initiated with the testing phase completed the software application is ready for deployment and consumer use in this phase the development team will set up links for the application and make it accessible to the users after the deployment is completed and users begin using the application they may encounter an error or a bug in the application which is to be solved from time to time maintenance also includes releasing application updates and enhancements for the software for better performance and user experience Adam at this point was surprised by all the effort and steps taken by the development team to design a software application and the key phases involved in sdlc and on that note here's a question for you all what does the design document specification document include software code details on defects and bugs software architecture details software requirements give it a thought and leave your answers in the comments section below three lucky winners will receive Amazon gift vouchers with Mark's explanation of the sdlc life cycle Adam understood how software is developed now he can actively give feedback to the development team and design the best software application for his online store and maybe expand to other businesses as well we hope you found this informative and helpful if you've enjoyed this video a thumbs up would really be appreciated don't forget to subscribe to this simply

        "transcript": "to become a mobile app developer there are five essential skills let's go over them one by one there are basically two ways to build mobile apps native or crossplatform with Native development we can build an app that runs only on a particular platform like iOS or Android this approach gives us full control over the capabilities of the target platform resulting in great performance and the best user experience however the downside is that if you want to build the same app for a different platform form we have to create a separate project in an entirely different language and ecosystem this means two separate projects and two sets of bugs to fix that's where crossplatform or multiplatform development comes to the rescue with crossplatform development we can reduce development Time by reusing the same code for different platforms and potentially reduce bugs fixing a bug once means it's fixed across multiple platforms now for Native development we have a few options for iOS we can use Objective C which is an older language or Swift which is modern and preferred for Android we can use Java which is a traditional language or cotland which is modern and preferred for crossplatform development the option depends on the framework or toolkit we use there are several crossplatform toolkits like react native flutter cotland multiplatform Maui and a few others let's dive into each one first off we have react native which was released by Facebook in 2015 this toolkit lets you build mobile apps using JavaScript and and react which is a popular library for building web user interfaces some big names using react native include Microsoft Office scype and even Facebook itself then we have flut which is a Google product that came out in 2017 flut uses a programming language called Dart which takes the best parts of JavaScript Java and C some examples of apps built with flutter are eBay Alibaba and Google pay it's really powerful and gaining a lot of traction now let's talk about cotland multiplatform this is the newest player released by jetbrains the same company behind tools like intellig pycharm and webstorm in my opinion the best idees in the world it uses the cotlin programming language which is a modern language inspired by Java apps like McDonald's Netflix and cash app are built with cotton multiplatform finally we have Maui which stands for net multiplatform appui introduced by Microsoft Maui allows you to build native mobile and desktop apps using C and . net these days most companies prefer to use multiplatform development to reduce their costs this means we can rule out native development for now and focus on cross-platform options now which framework is the best well there is no such a thing as the best framework yes there are people out there like our Superstar highly opinionated developer Mr John Smith who swears by react native but there are others with a different opinion the reality is that neither of these Frameworks is perfect each has its own problems and quirks that you you will discover once you start building real applications Beyond YouTube tutorials and the reason for that is that they try to support two entirely different platforms at the same time so which crossplatform solution should you choose well it depends on two things first on what languages and Technologies you're familiar with for example if you're a c developer Maui might be the easier route if you know web Technologies like JavaScript and react you might want to go for react native it's an easier transition from web to mobile development the other factor is job opportunities there are often more jobs available for react native and flutter here you can see the number of open positions for different types of mobile app developers in the US now this is the current situation here and maybe different where you live maybe there are more job opportunities for a flutter developer so I recommend doing your own research rather than taking my or someone else's advice about which route to choose but realistically if you're looking for a career in Mobile development you would have to choose between react native and flutter if you have basic web development skills react native is a better route otherwise I would recommend flutter because Dart which is the programming language that flutter uses is a nicer language to work with than JavaScript it's more modern and doesn't have the quirks and weird Parts you find in JavaScript so decide between JavaScript or Dart and commit to a study plan I believe if you dedicate 3 to 5 hours every day you can learn the essence of either of these languages in about 2 months to help you on this journey I've created a free supplementary PDF that breaks down the specific Concepts you need to learn for each skill it also includes several project ideas to help you practice and apply what you have learned it's a great resource to review your progress find gaps in your knowledge and prepare for interviews you can find the link in the description Box by the way I have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if you're looking for structur learning again links are in the description box the next thing you need to learn is a Version Control System them like git git is not a programming language it's a tool we use to track changes to our code and collaborate with others git and GitHub which is a platform that hosts git repositories are essential for every developer now git has a ton of features but you don't need to know them all for everyday use think of it like the 8020 rule 80% of the time you use 20% of git's features 1 to two weeks of practice is enough to get up and running now building mobile apps often involves working with data structures and implementing complex algorithms this is where a lot of self-taught programmers struggle because they try to skip ahead and learn more and more languages and tools without learning the fundamentals of computer science data structures and algorithms are critical subjects taught to computer science students and they're often covered in Tech interviews especially at big companies like apple Google and Microsoft while you can skip this step and go to the next as someone who has had the privilege of teaching millions of people I highly recommend you not to overlook this step otherwise you're going to feel the pain later in your career so spend 1 to 2 months studying classic data structures and algorithms this will give you a strong foundation in programming and problem solving the next thing I would recommend learning which again a lot of self-taught developers Miss is design patterns design patterns are proven solutions to Common software design problems there are 23 classic design patterns documented in the book design patterns by the gang of four many of these patterns are used in Mobile Frameworks so learning them will give you a deeper understanding of object-oriented design principles and how these mobile Frameworks work under the hood now I have to tell you this book is pretty old and written in C++ honestly it's a difficult read because many of the examples in the book are dry and not quite relevant to Modern software that's why I've created a very Hands-On and pragmatic course on this topic where I use Java and modern examples found in applications we use every day you can see how design patterns are used to solve problems in modern applications whether you want to take my course or use a different resource I believe if you dedicate a few hours every day you can have a pretty solid understanding of design patterns in about 2 months all right the next thing you need to learn is a mobile framework which we talked about before for Dart you should learn flutter and for JavaScript you should learn react native assuming you have a solid background in programming you can learn either of these Frameworks in about 2 months so if you dedicated a few hours every day and follow this road map you'll have the necessary knowledge to apply for an entry-level mobile developer job in about 8 to 12 months if you have any questions please let me know in the comments below I'll do my best to answer you right here or in my future videos If you enjoyed this video please give it a like And subscribe
